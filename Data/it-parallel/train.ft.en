Different printers need the raster image prepared in different ways. Thinking about an inkjet device: depending on its resolution, the number of inks used (the very good ones need 7 different inks, while cheaper ones might only use 3), the number of available jets (some print heads have more than 100!) dispensing ink simultaneously, the dithering algorithm used, and many other things, the final raster format and transfer order to the marking engine is heavily dependent on the exact model used.

Note: the shown cost is only the cost which is spent while the active function was actually running; i. e. the cost shown for main() - if it is visible - should be the same as the cost of the active function, as that is the part of inclusive cost of main() spent while the active function was running. For cycles, blue call arrows indicate that this is an artificial call added for correct drawing which actually never happened.

However, stars also show a great diversity in some properties. The brightest stars shine almost 100 million times as brightly as the faintest stars. Stars range in surface temperature from only a few thousand degrees to almost 50,000 degrees Celsius.

The temperature and Luminosity also depend on the evolutionary state of the star.

Here you should enter the IP address for the network interface. Please note: If your network is connected to the internet, you should only enter IP addresses you have been given by your provider. Otherwise, you should enter one of the IP addresses which are explicitly reserved for private use. Most small private networks use class C networks, which allow up to 255 computers in your network. So simply use addresses like 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.171 and so on for your computers. Class C networks: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255, for example 192.168.0.13. Class B networks: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255, for example 172.28.2.5 Class A networks: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255, for example 10.5.12.14 Please ensure that all IP addresses you give to your computers are unique; you will have many problems if the same address is assigned to more than one network device.

The values w and d are special - they are sort of intermediate values. By choosing a concealed tile as last tile, the source is set to w. Next, several rules say that they apply only if the last tile comes from the wall. So this allows for a better preselection of actually applicable manual rules.

Meta contacts are one of the features of & kopete; that make sense once you figure out what they are. Until you do, they annoy you. They are basically a way of taking a contact on one network (such as MSN) and linking it to another contact on a different network. This is useful for when people have accounts on different networks as you can chat to them without needing to know which account they are signed on to. This also lets you assign names to your meta-contacts that do n't change when people change their names on their account, this is useful if you have contacts who insist upon setting their MSN nick to something like =EF=81=8A.

JPEG Chroma subsampling level (color is saved with less resolution than luminance): None =best: uses 4:4:4 ratio. Does not employ chroma subsampling at all. This preserves edges and contrasting colors, whilst adding no additional compression Medium: uses 4:2:2 ratio. Medium compression: reduces the color resolution by one-third with little to no visual difference High: use 4:1:1 ratio. High compression: suits images with soft edges but tends to alter colors Note: JPEG always uses lossy compression.

At the beginning of the 20th century, scientists Lord Rayleigh, and Max Planck (among others) studied the blackbody radiation using such a device. After much work, Planck was able to empirically describe the intensity of light emitted by a blackbody as a function of wavelength.

Planet positions are only accurate for dates within 4000 years or so of the current epoch. The planet positions are predicted using a Fourier-like analysis of their orbits, as observed over the past few centuries. We learnt in school that planets follow simple elliptical orbits around the Sun, but this is not strictly true. It would be true only if there was only one planet in the Solar system, and if the Sun and the planet were both point masses. As it is, the planets are constantly tugging on each other, perturbing the orbits slightly, and tidal effects also induce precessional wobbling. In fact, recent analysis suggests that the planets' orbits may not even be stable in the long term (i. e., millions or billions of years). As a rule of thumb, you can expect the position of a planet to be accurate to a few arcseconds between the dates -2000 and 6000.

Physical deterioration of the media happens more rapidly with paper and CD-Rs than the average of film. Yet while film lasts longer (sometimes decades longer) than other forms of media, the right kind of backup of digital media never loses anything. Film decays - digital 1's and 0's do not, and film starts to decay the moment it's created and developed. It will never have the same color, contrast, & etc; that it did have a moment before. Digital does n't do that. However, digital is susceptible to corruption! And yes, physical media such as floppies and magnetic hard drives are also susceptible to the decay of the medium, just like CDs are. They just last longer.

Quickly go right and down the staircase, with the enemy following. Dig once, about halfway down. After the last gold piece, dig and go up on the underladder. Wait under the next brick down from where the enemy is trapped. The enemy will climb out and descend, Run through the opening where he was, before it closes. You can then use him to move over to the next underladder to the right. Run to the top of the underladder, over and down the staircase. Dig left while standing on the enemy and then dig right, underneath the enemy, when you are next him. Run over him, to collect any gold he has, and then down a few steps. Dig and go up the underladder, to wait for him to be reborn and come down your staircase, so that you can use him to move across to the next underladder. Repeat for the remaining staircases to the right until you can get to the top pole. Go across to the far left and fall to the top brick of the bottom left section. Collect all the gold, leaving the piece on the far left of the second staircase for last, otherwise you will fall and be trapped. Evade the enemies by running up ladders and luring them onto steps. Run all the way to the right and up the last ladder. Dig as necessary to outwit the enemies, proceeding through the remaining cascades and up the ladders on the far right to end the level.

Equalize: this method adjusts the brightness of colors across the selected image so that the histogram for the Value channel is as flat as possible, that is, so that each possible brightness value appears at about the same number of pixels as each other value. Sometimes Equalize works wonderfully at enhancing the contrasts of an image. Other times it gives garbage. It is a very powerful operation, which can either work miracles on an image or destroy it.

Users with many fonts may find it useful to only have certain fonts enabled (or active) at certain times. To facilitate this, this module will allow you to disable individual fonts, or whole groups of fonts. Disabling a font does not remove the font from the system, it simply hides it so that it no longer appears within applications. Re-enabling a font will then allow it to be used.

How surges happen A power surge occurs when the power line voltage increases over nominal values for more than 10 milliseconds. Sixty percent of all power surges are caused from within the home or office, generally when a device with a motor (such as a hair dryer, refrigerator, or water pump) shuts off and the power it was using is diverted elsewhere as excess voltage. The remaining 40 percent of power surges are generated by factors such as lightning, utility grid switching, line slapping, poor wiring, and so on. While most average electricity-using devices are not affected by power surges, devices relying on computer chips and high-speed microprocessors are susceptible to serious damage. For your computer, power anomalies can result in keyboard lockup, complete data loss, hardware degradation, damaged motherboards, and more. Failure to protect yourself from the inevitable can result in a loss of both time and money. Surge protectors The most common defense against power surges is a surge protector or suppressor, a device that works by absorbing some of the excess energy and diverting the rest of it to the ground. These are usually found in the form of a power strip (one of those long devices that have six or so outlets and a single, grounded plug). Bear in mind, however, that not every power strip serves as a surge protector. When selecting your surge protector, you want to be sure it is listed as meeting the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. You should also look for one that offers protection against lightning (not every one does) and provides insurance for equipment that is properly attached. Because a power surge can follow any path to your computer, be sure that each peripheral connected to your system is protected. this includes your phone line or cable modem, as power can surge through these routes as well. A number of manufacturers are now producing surge suppressors that feature a phone jack for your modem along with the electrical outlets, while others have coaxial cable jacks for those who use a cable modem or TV tuner card. If you have a notebook computer, you will want to carry a surge suppressor as well. A variety of suppressors designed specifically for notebooks are available, small in size and possessing both electric and phone outlets that make them ideal for use on the road. Uninterruptible power supply (UPS) While a surge suppressor will protect your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it won ’ t help you if the power should black out completely. Even an outage of just a few seconds can result in the loss of valuable data, so you might find it worthwhile to invest in an uninterruptible power supply. Besides serving as surge suppressors, these devices automatically switch to battery power when a power outage occurs, giving you the opportunity to save data and shut down your system. Some models will even allow you to keep working until power is restored. When purchasing a UPS, be sure that it has the same qualities that you would seek in a surge suppressor, but also check out the battery life and included software. Considering the potential risk to your computing system, ensuring its safety from power disturbances is a worthwhile investment. A quality surge suppressor will cost you upward of & euro; 20, a 500W UPS can be had for less than & euro; 40. It ’ s a small cost to pay for the peace of mind you ’ ll gain knowing your computer is well protected. In the very least pull all lines to your computer when you go on holidays.

A basic requirement for studying the heavens is determining where in the sky things are. To specify sky positions, astronomers have developed several coordinate systems. Each uses a coordinate grid projected on the Celestial Sphere, in analogy to the Geographic coordinate system used on the surface of the Earth. The coordinate systems differ only in their choice of the fundamental plane, which divides the sky into two equal hemispheres along a great circle. (the fundamental plane of the geographic system is the Earth's equator). Each coordinate system is named for its choice of fundamental plane.

If your disk is making weird noises, normal file recovery software isn’ t going to work. Do a quick backup if that is going to happen to you. If the drive is still spinning and you can’ t find your data, look for a data recovery utility and backup to another computer or drive. (Non-Linux; users: Google for & quot; free data recovery softwarequot; for some options, including one from Ontrack). The important thing is to download them onto another drive, either on another computer, or onto a USB thumb drive or hard disk. It is good practice to save the recovered data to another disk. dd is your friend on *nix systems.

Even easier: just press Alt+F2 (if you have not changed this shortcut) and enter the shortcut in the KDE Run Command dialog.

Filters convert print files from a given input format to another format that is acceptable to the target printer. In many cases filters may be connected to a whole filter "chain", where only the result of the last conversion is sent to the printer. The actual transfer of the print data to the device is performed by a "backend".

A high value for the acceleration will lead to large movements of the mouse pointer on the screen even when you only make a small movement with the physical device.

The Eye of Horus is an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection and royal power from deities. On this level, there is some protection inside the eye, but not much. Repeated trips from the top to the bottom are required to get all the treasure. Eventually, there will be two mummies on the bottom left. To get by them, climb to the top of the short ladder four from the left, dig left, climb down and dig left again. One of the mummies will fall in the lower pit. Climb up the ladder. The second mummy will climb the other ladder and fall in the top pit. Move across the two trapped mummies and climb to the top.

It is possible to write simple scripts that do not need user interaction, and it's also possible to make scripts with comfortable GUIs that act like little applications of their own. For GUI programming one of the many bindings which KDE provides can be used, for instance RubyQt, a Qt library binding for Ruby. However, it is worth noting that not every user has all available bindings installed. If you decide to use a binding, try to use one of the relatively wide spread ones (e. g. RubyQt or PyQt).

PNG is an extensible file format for the lossless, portable, well-compressed storage of raster images. PNG provides a patent-free replacement for & GIF; and can also replace many common uses of TIFF. PNG is designed to work well in on-line viewing applications, such as the World Wide Web, so it is fully streamable with a progressive display option. Also, PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color matching on heterogeneous platforms. PNG supports 8 and 16 bits / colors / pixels depth. It's the perfect file format to archive your photographs. For more information about the PNG format see the PNG homepage.

Spiral galaxies are very dynamic entities. They are hotbeds of star formation, and contain many young stars in their disks. Their central bulges tend to be made of older stars, and their diffuse halos are made of the very oldest stars in the Universe. Star formation is active in the disks because that is where the gas and dust are most concentrated; gas and dust are the building blocks of star formation.

The story began in 1933 when Astronomer Fritz Zwicky was studying the motions of distant and massive clusters of galaxies, specifically the Coma cluster and the Virgo cluster. Zwicky estimated the mass of each galaxy in the cluster based on their luminosity, and added up all of the galaxy masses to get a total cluster mass. He then made a second, independent estimate of the cluster mass, based on measuring the spread in velocities of the individual galaxies in the cluster. To his suprise, this second dynamical mass estimate was 400 times larger than the estimate based on the galaxy light.

Main Curves Editing Area: the horizontal bar (x-axis) represents input values (they are value levels from 0 to 255). The vertical bar (y-axis) is only a scale for output colors of the selected channel. The control curve is drawn on a grid and crosses the histogram diagonally. The pointer x/ y position is permanently displayed above the grid. If you click on the curve, a control point is created. You can move it to bend the curve. If you click outside the curve, a control point is also created, and the curve includes it automatically. So each point of the curve represents an'x 'translated into a'y' output level.

Congratulations. Your minimal setup is done. Remember, you can customize more settings using the digiKam configuration panel. To learn more about the digiKam world, we recommend reading the digiKam handbook using the Help/ Handbook menu entry (you need to install the separate digiKam documentation package.) You can also read the manual online from the digikam. org website. Press Finish to close this assistant. digiKam will scan your collection to register all items in the database. Note: depending of your collection size, this operation can take a while. If you cancel the scanning operation, it will start again at next digiKam session. When scanning has completed, at next start-up, digiKam will only check your collection to identify new items - which is much faster. Scanning for images can also be started manually using the Tool/ Scan for New Images menu entry.

You move by clicking on a vacant square or one you already own. If you click on a vacant square, you gain ownership over it and the square’ s color changes to your playing color. Each time you click on a square, the value of the square increases by one. If the square's value reaches a maximum, its points are distributed among the square’ s immediate neighbors (the points jump around). If a neighboring square happens to be owned by the other player, it gets taken over, together with all of its points, and changes to your playing color.

With the upcoming of the DVD-V media, a new VCD standard had to be published in order to be able to keep up with technology, so the Super Video CD specification was called into life 1999. In the midst of 2000 a full subset of this Super Video CD specification was published as IEC-62107. As the most notable change over Video CD 2.0 is a switch from MPEG-1 CBR to MPEG-2 VBR encoding for the video stream was performed. The following new features--building upon the Video CD 2.0 specification--are: Use of MPEG-2 encoding instead of MPEG-1 for the video stream. Allowed VBR encoding of MPEG-1 audio stream. Higher resolutions (see below) for video stream resolution. Up to 4 overlay graphics and text ("OGT") sub-channels for user switchable subtitle displaying in addition to the already existing closed caption facility. Command lists for controlling the SVCD virtual machine. For the Super Video CD, only the following two resolutions are supported for motion video and (low resolution) still pictures:480 x 480 @ 29.97 Hz (NTSC 2/ 3 D-2).480 x 576 @ 25 Hz (PAL 2/ 3 D-2).

Imhotep designed the Step Pyramid of Djoser to serve as a gigantic stairway by which the soul of the deceased pharaoh could ascend to the heavens. Such was the importance of Imhotep's achievement that he was deified by later Egyptians. Before you can ascend to the top of this pyramid level, you must make your way to the bottom. To get the top piece of treasure, move left off the apex, dig the next block and step onto the mummy below, continuing to move right (try placing your mouse pointer on the apex). After getting the last piece of treasure, exit to the right and run up and down the ladders. The lower left is the only difficult part: just run under the mummies on the ladder above you and maneuver... and hope!

Our goal with templates is to extend them to include multi file concept templates useful for things like placing an order or creating an about section.

An eventual goal is to have a structural template design mode to deal with site layout and structure which you could use to design and interactively update your sites.

About two years after the Video CD 1.1 specification came out, an improved Video CD 2.0 standard was published in 1995. This one added the following items to the features already available in the Video CD 1.1 specification: Support for MPEG segment play items ("SPI"), consisting of still pictures, motion pictures and/ or audio (only) streams was added. Note Segment Items::. Support for interactive playback control ("PBC") was added. Support for playing related access by providing a scan point index file was added. ("/ EXT/ SCANDATA. DAT")Support for closed captions. Support for mixing NTSC and PAL content. By adding PAL support to the Video CD 1.1 specification, the following resolutions became available:352 x 240 @ 29.97 Hz (NTSC SIF).352 x 240 @ 23.976 Hz (FILM SIF).352 x 288 @ 25 Hz (PAL SIF). For segment play items the following audio encodings became available: Joint stereo, stereo or dual channel audio streams at 128, 192, 224 or 384 kbit/ sec bit-rate. Mono audio streams at 64, 96 or 192 kbit/ sec bit-rate. Also the possibility to have audio only streams and still pictures was provided. The bit-rate of multiplex-ed streams should be kept under 174300 bytes/ sec (except for single still picture items) in order to accommodate single speed drives.

Usually, this would be the photographer, but if the image was done by an employee or as work-for-hire, then the agency or company should be listed. Use the form appropriate to your country. For the United States you would typically follow the form of © {date of first publication} name of copyright owner, as in'copr 2005 John Doe. 'The word'copyright' or the abbreviation'copr 'shall be used in place of the & copy; symbol as ASCII characters only are allowed. In some foreign countries only the copyright symbol is recognized and the abbreviation does not work. Using something like (c) where the parentheses form a partial circle is not sufficient. For additional protection worldwide, use of the phrase, 'all rights reserved' following the notice above is encouraged. In Europe you would use: Copyright {Year} {copyright owner}, all rights reserved. In Japan, for maximum protection, the following three items should appear in the copyright field of the IPTC Core: (a) the word, Copyright; (b) year of the first publication; and (c) name of the author.

Burets are used to titrate liquids. A buret is filled with a specific volume of a liquid, and placed beneath it is a container such as an Erlenmeyer flask. By opening the valve on the buret, the liquid in the container will then be titrated. High-quality burets have a venting mechanism with which they can be very easily refilled with the exact volume for which the buret is calibrated.

Trap the first enemy immediately. Go up and right and hang on the ladder to the right of a short bar. As the enemy arrives, climb up quickly. As he reaches you again, go left, drop and go up the left hand ladder to the top. The enemy should head right, over the concrete, and fall. Now go down to the bottom left corner. The enemy should drop into a false brick next to the gold. Collect all gold at the top, then dig and drop to the next enemy. Stand on him, dig left and move right. The enemy will drop into the pit. Move to the right and collect more gold as you fall. Climb to the top, drop onto the trapped enemy via a false brick under a bar and collect five more nuggets. Now dig and go down the short ladder at the right of the bricks, to kill the enemy in the pit (who has more gold). He should reappear above you and fall through a false brick back into the pit. Dig three bricks between the two enemies and go down the short ladder until the enemies bunch up. Dig two more bricks to release them. Go up the ladder, over the concrete and, just before the enemies get up to the concrete, drop down to the floor and run to the bottom of the short ladder. The enemies should come down and run into the double pit on the right. Quickly run out to the right, over the enemies. Drop onto the last piece of gold, over on the right and the hidden ladders appear. Phew! P. S. Another way to trap the left hand enemy in the false brick is to get him to follow you up the leftmost ladder while you run across the top and dig to drop onto the second enemy. Timing is VERY tight. You must dig and drop before the enemy climbs over the top left and runs right. Later, climb the right hand ladders to the top, wait on the left hand bar over a false brick till the leftmost enemy starts to run towards you, then drop. Wait again till he starts to drop, then dig two bricks at the right of a short ladder, go right and drop, then run left to the bottom of a short ladder. The enemy should drop through a false brick and a ladder into the false brick beneath. P. P. S. There is no room for error or hesitation in this method! Not much in the first method either!

If a & kde; developer needs printing access for his application, he does not code the printing functions from scratch. Before & kde; 2.2 this service was provided by the QPrinter class, a library function of the & Qt; Toolkit. The QPrinter class relied on the out-moded Line Printer Daemon (LPD). The & kdeprint; library bases itself firmly on the more modern Common & UNIX; Printing System (CUPS;), while at the same time keeping backward compatibility with LPD and other legacy, or less elaborate, print systems. It also leaves the door open for any new development that might occur.

Stop stressing about the loss and don ’ t do anything to the disk. Better yet, stop using the computer until you have a plan. Sit down and explain you plan to a laymen or better, laywoman.

The key thing to remember is that you do n't know how you or somebody else will try to find an image 2 years ahead of our time. You will remember past events in a different context, it's a fact of life.

Enter the URI that is used to do a search on the search engine here. The whole text to be searched for can be specified as \\{@} or \\{0}. Recommended is \\{@}, since it removes all query variables (name=value) from the resulting string whereas \\{0} will be substituted with the unmodified query string. You can use \\{1}... \\{n} to specify certain words from the query and \\{name} to specify a value given by'name=value 'in the user query. In addition it is possible to specify multiple references (names, numbers and strings) at once (\\{name1, name2,..., "string"}). The first matching value (from the left) will be used as substitution value for the resulting URI. A quoted string can be used as default value if nothing matches from the left of the reference list.

& kmag; is a screen magnifier for the K Desktop Environment (kde;). It can be used to magnify a part of the screen. This application can be useful to various people: People with low vision can use this application to magnify a part of the screen which they are unable to view clearly, artists can use this application to zoom into the graphics they produce and verify it at the pixel level, image-processing researchers can use this application to zoom into images and study them closely. Other than these, & kmag; can be used for various other purposes & eg; is possible to use the application for grabbing a portion of the screen and saving it to the disk (with an option of zooming the screen captured).

Two schedulers are available: Normal: This is the standard, timesharing scheduler. It will divide fairly the available processing time between all processes. Realtime: This scheduler will run your application uninterrupted until it gives up the processor. This can be dangerous. An application that does not give up the processor might hang the system. You need root's password to use the scheduler.

This sets the score equal to a number from 25-75, depending on how far through the song was allowed to play. For example, if the user stops or skips the song after only 25% of it has played, the score will be set to (50+25)/ 2, or 37.5. Scores are displayed as integers, however, so this number is rounded to the nearest integer before being displayed. The score is kept internally as a floating point number however, since after a song has been played several times, it may be impossible to alter the score by more than a point with a single play (see below). When defining a score for a track which has been played before, the calculation is a bit more complicated. In the source, it is score = ((values[2]. toDouble() * values. first(). toInt()) + percentage) / (values. first(). toInt() + 1);

The one thing that differentiates the archiving capabilities of film vs digital is that with digital you can make as many new originals as you want. With film you only have one original. All copies will have a slightly lower quality, and both originals and copies are more or less slowly aging and disappearing. The only way to keep it "forever fresh" is to make a digital copy of it. And that is also the only way to protect it from all hazards.

However, the problem was n't completely solved by the Julian calendar, because a tropical year is n't 365.25 days long; it's 365.24219 days long. You still have a calendar drift problem, it just takes many centuries to become noticeable. And so, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII instituted the Gregorian calendar, which was largely the same as the Julian Calendar, with one more trick added for leap years: even Century years (those ending with the digits 00) are only leap years if they are divisible by 400. So, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not leap years (though they would have been under the Julian Calendar), whereas the year 2000 was a leap year. This change makes the average length of a year 365.2425 days. So, there is still a tiny calendar drift, but it amounts to an error of only 3 days in 10,000 years. The Gregorian calendar is still used as a standard calendar throughout most of the world.

The Parts tab shows a list of trace parts if the trace consists of more than one part (otherwise, this tab is hidden). The cost of the selected function spent in the different parts together with the calls happening is shown. The Call Lists tab shows direct callers and callees of the function in more detail. The Coverage tab shows the same as the Call Lists tab, but also shows indirect callers and callees, not just direct ones. The Call Graph tab shows a graphical visualization of the calls made by this function. The Source Code tab presents annotated source code if debugging information and the source file are available. The Machine Code tab presents annotated assembly instructions if profile information at instruction level is available.

This is a slow level with lots of waiting for enemies to move where you want them. At the start, fall onto the nearest enemy as it falls and move onto the right hand poles to get the piece of gold just below them. Be sure to wait for an opening in the enemies below before dropping onto this gold piece. The grid of 12 boxes on the right is useful. If you are on this grid but below the top of it, enemies climbing the ladder just left of the grid will not drop onto the grid and chase you. You can wait near the bottom of the grid until the enemies move above the pits of brick and concrete at the bottom left, then you can fall to the floor. This will cause the enemies to fall into the pits and become trapped. Another useful trick is to wait at the top of the ladder on the far left (where you start the level). Any enemies far enough away will run over the top of the grid of boxes and drop into the trapped area on the right. To get the gold on the leftmost floor area, you need to fill the second section of floor with enemies and dig out the squares that block the enemies in the leftmost region. You may want to lose that gold (i. e. have the enemy carrying the gold enter a dug square and be destroyed there), although it is possible to get this piece of gold if you really want it. If you leave the leftmost suspended gold until last, then it is easy to escape to the top. Alternatively, if you leave the gold inside the 2 for last, you should be able to escape without much difficultly. Otherwise, the enemies trapped on the far left will cut off your escape route.

The geographic location chosen to represent Universal Time is Greenwich, England. The choice is arbitrary and historical. Universal Time became an important concept when European ships began to sail the wide open seas, far from any known landmarks. A navigator could reckon the ship's longitude by comparing the Local Time (as measured from the Sun's position) to the time back at the home port (as kept by an accurate clock on board the ship). Greenwich was home to England's Royal Observatory, which was charged with keeping time very accurately, so that ships in port could re-calibrate their clocks before setting sail.

Regular expressions are easy to use but often there is another much faster way to achieve the same result. Consider you only want to match the character '# 'if it is the first character in the line. A regular expression based solution would look like this: lt; RegExpr attribute=quot; Macroquot; context=quot; macroquot; String=quot; ^\\s*#quot; / gt; You can achieve the same much faster in using: lt; DetectChar attribute=quot; Macroquot; context=quot; macroquot; char=quot; #quot; firstNonSpace=quot; truequot; / gt; If you want to match the regular expression '^#' you can still use DetectChar with the attribute column=quot; 0quot;. The attribute column counts character based, so a tabulator still is only one character.

This may sound odd, (why playing a trumpet when the song is made to play a piano?), but it is very useful. The GM standard specifies that when a midi keyboard receives an event to change patch to 0, it will change the current patch to Grand Piano, but older synthesizer will change for example to a Electric Guitar when it receives a 0. This old keyboard, needed to receive a 3 (for example) to change to a Piano. And here comes the midi map in action, changing all change patch to 0 to change patch to 3 and thus really playing the correct instrument when it has to.

When exporting images, bear in mind that there are two things the person importing these images again will need: 1) meta information (image content, date etc.) 2) the images themselves. The images themselves can either be placed next to the. kim file, or copied into the. kim file. Copying the images into the. kim file works well for a recipient who wants all, or most of those images, for example when emailing a whole group of images. However, when you place the images on the Web, a lot of people will see them but most likely only download a few of them. It works better in this kind of case, to separate the images and the. kim file, by place them next to each other, so the user can access the images s/ he wants.

Moreover, the cube might be placed on the home bar and if it can be doubled, double clicking it will do so.

Already years ago experts were not able to differentiate a 256 kbps mp3 from the & CD; original and that was in a blind test with a HiFi system which you might never be able to effort. That still will reduce the storage space of the original wav by the factor of 5.5. On most modern systems you can as well use variable bit rate. Here the encoder varies the bit rate depending the complexity of the music according to its psychoacoustic model. The lame setting '--preset extreme 'generates a file with a VBR (variable bit rate in opposite to CBR, constant bit rate) of 224 to 256 kbps, depending the complexity of the music. This will compress the original by a factor up to 6.3 and will play on nearly everything currently on the market.

To extract data, & eg;, into a spreadsheet or external file, it is almost invariably necessary to select linked data from more than one table. This is done by'joining 'the tables, using a field which is common to each. You can find a lot more information about how this is done from the online database tutorials mentioned above. The following table lists the fields used to define these inter-table relationships.

The Horizontal coordinate system uses the observer's local horizon as the Fundamental Plane. This conveniently divides the sky into the upper hemisphere that you can see, and the lower hemisphere that you ca n't (because the Earth is in the way). The pole of the upper hemisphere is called the Zenith. The pole of the lower hemisphere is called the nadir. The angle of an object above or below the horizon is called the Altitude (Alt for short). The angle of an object around the horizon (measured from the North point, toward the East) is called the Azimuth. The Horizontal Coordinate System is sometimes also called the Alt/ Az Coordinate System.

The only way to be sure which settings of Density, Power, and Radius best compensate for the actual optical characteristics of a given lens is to expose a uniformly illuminated scene (for example, a grey card lit by diffuse light) and perform densitometry on the resulting image (for example with Adjust Level tool histogram position bar). Failing that, or specifications by the lens manufacturer giving the precise degree of vignetting at one or more working apertures, you may have to experiment with different settings to find those which work best for each of your lenses. For help you in this task, the widget dialog provide a thumbnail mask rendering applied on the image. Fortunately, the response of the human eye is logarithmic, not linear like most digital imaging sensors, so you need n't precisely compensate for the actual vignetting to create images which viewers will perceive as uniformly illuminated.

Teletext PID:
The column to the left of the 1 requires a quick run down and back up, with careful dodging both ways to avoid the enemies. To get the gold in the middle of the 6, drop down on the top of the'O 'part of the 6, move right/ dig left and immediately move left and dig left to delay the enemy who otherwise is likely to catch you. However, you may wish to leave this piece of gold to the end so as not to free two additional enemies earlier; it is possible to get two enemies to retrap themselves in that section, though. To get the gold held by enemies in the bottom right, dig out the blocking square to their left, run up the ladder, dig off the right side of the 6, drop in, run left and dig off a square on the left side of the 6 and drop to the floor. The timing is tight - only one or two enemies in the bottom right section will be able to move to the next section to the left. You will still need to dig out the bottom of the 6 to get their gold, but that is straightforward albeit a bit hectic because of the enemies lingering to the left of the 6. Once you have gotten all the gold, you may find it easiest to exit by passing through the middle false floor on the 1 and exiting via the ladders on the left of the 1.

Which sizes will be offered by the icon size listbox depends on the icon theme you have selected in the icon themes control module. For example, the low color icon theme only offers the sizes 16 and 32 for desktop icons and 16, 22 and 32 for toolbar icons. The HiColor theme offers icon sizes 16, 32 and 48 as well as sizes from 64 to 128. However, as & kde; can not have all these icon sizes in store, icons using size 64 to 128 will be automatically generated which may result in a loss of quality.

eMovix Boot Labels eMovix provides a variety of different boot configurations which can be selected at boot time via a boot label (comparable to Lilo or Grub). The many different boot configurations mainly influence the Video output. The default, movix, or MoviX labels start a general Vesa video driver. The TV labels can be used to direct video to the TV output of the graphic board. eMovix provides TVout drivers for different brands of graphic boards. The FB labels refer to configurations that start a Frame Buffer driver in different screen resolutions. The AA labels make eMovix output the video through the ASCII-Art library which displays the picture in text mode through the usage of simple ASCII characters. The hd label makes eMovix boot from the local harddisk instead of the medium. This can be used to prevent accidental starting of an eMovix medium. The floppy label makes eMovix boot from the local floppy drive instead of the medium.

The To-do List is a place for you to write down notes to yourself about things that you need to do. To-dos are tasks, that may or may not be scheduled. There are short-term and long-term to-dos. For instance you should go to a hairdresser within a week, and you should sell your old car within a year. You likely do not want an alarm go off at a particular time, you just want to have a list of things that you must do, and dates when they must be finished at the latest (date due).

The process to run is chosen from the list of other Normal or Batch processes based on a dynamic priority that is determined only inside this list. The dynamic priority is based on the priority level given and increased for each time-quantum the process is ready to run, but denied to run by the scheduler. This ensures fair progress among all Normal processes.

CD-Text If this option is checked K3b uses some otherwise unused space on the Audio CD to store additional information, such as the artist's name or the CD title. CD-Text is an extension to the audio CD standard introduced by Sony. CD-Text will only be usable on CD players that support this extension (mostly car CD players) and software like K3b, of course. Since a CD-Text-enhanced Audio CD will work in any Hifi CD or DVD player even if the player does not support CD-Text explicitly, enabling it is never a bad idea (just remember to fill in the CD-Text information).
With this setting K3b will create a two-channel stereo Dolby Digital audio stream.

The focus policy is used to determine the active window, i. e. the window you can work in. Click to focus: A window becomes active when you click into it. This is the behavior you might know from other operating systems. Focus follows mouse: Moving the mouse pointer actively on to a normal window activates it. New windows will receive the focus, without you having to point the mouse at them explicitly. Very practical if you are using the mouse a lot. Focus under mouse: The window that happens to be under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, the last window that was under the mouse has focus. New windows will not automatically receive the focus. Focus strictly under mouse: Only the window under the mouse pointer is active. If the mouse points nowhere, nothing has focus. Note that'Focus under mouse 'and'Focus strictly under mouse' prevent certain features such as the Alt+Tab walk through windows dialog in the KDE mode from working properly.

The IMAP4rev1 protocol (Internet Message Access Protocol) allows access to messages in mail folders on a server. Unlike POP3, which is designed to download the mails and delete them from the server, the purpose of IMAP is to store all mails on the server to be able to access these mails from everywhere. Messages can be stored on the server, retrieved from there or moved between folders.

The Ghostview program, which Okular uses internally to display the PostScript graphics that is included in this DVI file, is generally able to write its output in a variety of formats. The sub-programs that Ghostview uses for these tasks are called'device drivers'; there is one device driver for each format that Ghostview is able to write. Different versions of Ghostview often have different sets of device drivers available. It seems that the version of Ghostview that is installed on this computer does not contain any of the device drivers that are known to Okular. It seems unlikely that a regular installation of Ghostview would not contain these drivers. This error may therefore point to a serious misconfiguration of the Ghostview installation on your computer. If you want to fix the problems with Ghostview, you can use the command gs --help to display the list of device drivers contained in Ghostview. Among others, Okular can use the'png256 ', 'jpeg' and'pnm 'drivers. Note that Okular needs to be restarted to re-enable PostScript support.

Diff files contain only the changes made between files, or a set of files within a folder system, and may or may not contain a number of context lines before and after line changes. The sum of a line change and its context lines is known a hunk. A diff file therefore may contain multiple hunks from one or more files. When the context lines of two or more hunks overlap, they are considered a single hunk. Diff files can be used to:

Actually, we are not quite done yet. We should probably make sure that the display is using Equatorial coordinates before the script tracks the Moon with an accelerated time step. Otherwise, if the display is using Horizontal coordinates, it will rotate very quickly through large angles as the Moon rises and sets. This can be very confusing, and is avoided by setting the View Option UseAltAz to false. To change any View Option, use the changeViewOption function. Add this function to the script, and examine the Function Arguments panel. There is a combobox which contains the list of all options which can be adjusted by changeViewOption. Since we know we want the UseAltAz option, we could simply select it from the combobox. However, the list is quite long, and there is no explanation of what each item is for. It therefore may be easier to press the Browse Tree button, which will open a window containing a tree view of the available options, organized by topic. In addition, each item has a short explanation of what the option does, and the data type of the option's value. We find UseAltAz under the Skymap options category. Just highlight this item and press OK, and it will be selected in the combobox of the Function Arguments panel. Finally, make its value false or 0.
