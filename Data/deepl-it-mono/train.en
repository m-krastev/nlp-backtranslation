Send Message Disposition Notifications with an empty sender string. Some servers might be configured to reject such messages, so if you are experiencing problems sending MDNs, make sure this option is set to false. To enable this feature, add a line reading: SendMDNsWithEmptySender=true to the [MDN] section of the kmail configuration file. If there is no such section, simply add "[MDN]" on a line by itself just above the option. Note that the default setting of "false" strictly speaking violates internet standards, but is set that way for practical reasons, to avoid servers rejecting MDNs that KMail generates because they think they are SPAM.

Here you can get some assistance in setting up KMail's filter rules to use some commonly-known anti-virus tools. The wizard can detect those tools on your computer as well as create filter rules to classify messages using these tools and to separate messages containing viruses. The wizard will not take any existing filter rules into consideration: it will always append the new rules. Warning: As KMail appears to be frozen during the scan of the messages for viruses, you may encounter problems with the responsiveness of KMail because anti-virus tool operations are usually time consuming; please consider deleting the filter rules created by the wizard to get back to the former behavior.

TRUE if there is a disposition string
Evaluate conditional expression. Exits with a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evaluation of EXPR. Expressions may be unary or binary. Unary expressions are often used to examine the status of a file. There are string operators and numeric comparison operators as well. The behavior of test depends on the number of arguments. Read the bash manual page for the complete specification. File operators: -a FILE True if file exists. -b FILE True if file is block special. -c FILE True if file is character special. -d FILE True if file is a directory. -e FILE True if file exists. -f FILE True if file exists and is a regular file. -g FILE True if file is set-group-id. -h FILE True if file is a symbolic link. -L FILE True if file is a symbolic link. -k FILE True if file has its `sticky' bit set. -p FILE True if file is a named pipe. -r FILE True if file is readable by you. -s FILE True if file exists and is not empty. -S FILE True if file is a socket. -t FD True if FD is opened on a terminal. -u FILE True if the file is set-user-id. -w FILE True if the file is writable by you. -x FILE True if the file is executable by you. -O FILE True if the file is effectively owned by you. -G FILE True if the file is effectively owned by your group. -N FILE True if the file has been modified since it was last read. FILE1 -nt FILE2 True if file1 is newer than file2 (according to modification date). FILE1 -ot FILE2 True if file1 is older than file2. FILE1 -ef FILE2 True if file1 is a hard link to file2. String operators: -z STRING True if string is empty. -n STRING STRING True if string is not empty. STRING1 = STRING2 True if the strings are equal. STRING1 != STRING2 True if the strings are not equal. STRING1 STRING2 True if STRING1 sorts after STRING2 lexicographically. Other operators: -o OPTION True if the shell option OPTION is enabled. -v VAR\t True if the shell variable VAR is set ! EXPR True if expr is false. EXPR1 -a EXPR2 True if both expr1 AND expr2 are true. EXPR1 -o EXPR2 True if either expr1 OR expr2 is true. arg1 OP arg2 Arithmetic tests. OP is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge. Arithmetic binary operators return true if ARG1 is equal, not-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal, greater-than, or greater-than-or-equal than ARG2. Exit Status: Returns success if EXPR evaluates to true; fails if EXPR evaluates to false or an invalid argument is given.

If you happen to have one of the common & ATAPI; (or IDE) drives, with kernel 2.6 the device ID will range from / dev/ hda to / dev/ hdd. The master on channel 2 is a good starting point: that would be / dev/ hdc. If your hard disks are all S-ATA, / dev/ hda will probably do the trick. Native SCSI drives will start from / dev/ sda unless you have S-ATA hard disks, which come first in the list, so depending on the number of disks the & CD; /DVD drive will start at / dev/ sdb or / dev/ sdc.

While demosaicing your image you can additionally ask for noise reduction (at a slight speed penalty). This option applies a noise reduction algorithm while the image still is in CIE Lab color space. Because the noise is only applied to the Luminosity layer (the "L" of the Lab), it should not blur your image as traditional noise reduction algorithms do in RGB mode. So, if you converted an image from RAW and it appears noisy, rather than applying a denoiser, go back and re-convert with this option enabled. The defaults are: Threshold = 100. Higher values will increase the smoothing, lower will decrease smoothing.

Change the shell working directory. Change the current directory to DIR. The default DIR is the value of the HOME shell variable. The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing DIR. Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name is the same as the current directory. If DIR begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used. If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set, the word is assumed to be a variable name. If that variable has a value, its value is used for DIR. Options: -L\tforce symbolic links to be followed -P\tuse the physical directory structure without following symbolic \tlinks -e\tif the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory \tcannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified.

This value modifies the physical sort order of the files in the ISO9660 filesystem. A higher weighting means that the file will be located closer to the beginning of the image (and the disk). This option is useful in order to optimize the data layout on a medium. Caution: This does not sort the order of the file names that appear in the ISO9660 folder. It sorts the order in which the file data is written to the image.

Abbreviation for C ommon U NIX P rinting S ystem; & CUPS; is the most modern & UNIX; and Linux printing system, also providing cross-platform print services to & Microsoft; & Windows; and Apple & MacOS; clients. Based on IPP, it does away with all the pitfalls of old-style BSD printing, providing authentication, encryption and ACLs, plus many more features. At the same time it is backward-compatible enough to serve all legacy clients that are not yet up to IPP, via LPR/ LPD (BSD-style). & CUPS; is able to control any & PostScript; printer by utilizing the vendor-supplied PPD (PostScript Printer Description file), targeted originally for & Microsoft; Windows NT printing only. & kde; Printing is most powerful if based on & CUPS;.

& kommander; 's other significant factor is how it addresses the requirements of language. Computer languages can be wonderful things but they tend to have their own dogmas and zealots often seeking to provide an advance to & GUI; design in an integrated development environment. Ironically the acceptance of such & IDE; s is limited by the number of people willing to adopt a new new language to gain access to a desired feature. It is really not reasonable to expect people to need to change over to a dozen languages to access various feature sets. By being language neutral and allowing a & kommander; dialog to be extended by using any scripting language & kommander; positions itself in a unique position for wide spread adoption. Multiple script languages can be used in a single dialog and applications can be taken over by people using a different language than the original developer and gradually converting and extending it. New widgets and features can be instantly leveraged by all available languages.

You have to provide a workspace profile (linear profiles such as sRGB, ECI-RGB, LStar-RGB, Adobe-RGB or CIE-RGB). If you want to print your images, you may want to opt for Adobe RGB, if it is only for web publishing, sRGB is better (Adobe RGB will be displayed slightly dull in non color managed enabled software such as browsers). However you may change this later of course (by attributing another profile), therefore Adobe RGB can be a good choice for storing and image handling as you can always change it to sRGB before releasing an image for your blog.

VNG interpolation (Variable Number of Gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw but suffers from color artifacts on the edge. Bilinear is interesting if you are looking for speed with a acceptable result.

& kappname; is a simple one player strategy game played against the computer. The playing field is an 8 by 8 square board divided into 64 squares. The game pieces used are two sided stones, where each side has its own, distinctive color. If a piece is captured by an opposing player, that piece is turned over to reveal the color of that player. A winner is declared when one player has more pieces of his own color on the board and there are no more possible moves.

If we are going to track the Moon, we will need to point the display at it first. The lookToward function is used to do this. Highlight this function in the Function Browser, and note the documentation displayed in the panel below the Browser. Press the Add Function button to add this function to the Current Script box. The Function Arguments panel will now contain a combobox labeled dir, short for direction. This is the direction in which the display should be pointed. The combobox contains only the cardinal compass points, not the Moon or any other objects.

An Indirect entry also contains a host name, pattern or macro, but follows it with a list of host names or macros to which the queries should be forwarded. Indirect entries can be excluding as well, in which case a (valid) dummy host name must be supplied to make the entry distinguishable from a Direct entry. If compiled with IPv6 support, multicast address groups may also be included in the list of addresses the queries are forwarded to. If the indirect host list contains the keyword CHOOSER, Indirect queries are not forwarded, but instead a host chooser dialog is displayed by & kdm;. The chooser will send a Direct query to each of the remaining host names in the list and offer a menu of all the hosts that respond. The host list may contain the keyword BROADCAST, to make the chooser send a Broadcast query as well; note that on some operating systems, UDP packets cannot be broadcast, so this feature will not work.

The simplest tool to use is the Brightness/ Contrast/ Gamma tool. It is also the least powerful, but in many cases it does everything you need. This tool is often useful for images that are overexposed or underexposed; it is not useful for correcting color casts. The tool gives you three sliders to adjust, for "Brightness", "Contrast" and "Gamma". You can see any adjustments you make reflected in the preview image. When you are happy with the results, press Ok and they will take effect.

While all window decorations need to be compiled from source code, some window decorations can load pixmap-based theme files that do not need to be compiled. & kde; ships with a pixmap-based window decoration called the IceWM window decoration. Another pixmap-based window decoration is deKorator, which can be found on kde-look. org. Please refer to your distribution's documentation on how to install these. The advantage of using pixmap-based window decorations is it is relatively easy to make themes for them, by using images and editing a configuration file. The tradeoff is a slight loss of performance, while this may be unnoticeable on very fast systems.

Another source of ideas is the Demos Solution Moves menu item. One systematic way to solve a cube is to solve the bottom layer first, then the edge cubies in the middle layer and finally the top layer. The demos show sequences of moves on the 3x3x3 cube that will rearrange a few cubies at a time, without messing up parts of the cube you have already solved. One of the demos plays a complete solution of an example cube, using these methods, but it requires over 100 moves.

How can you solve these problems with a database? You can split information into smaller chunks by creating an additional table Persons with only two columns: Name and surname and Address:
A random natural number NN will be transformed in the date from 30st December 1899 (which is 0) with the number of days NN added. For example if you have a cell with 100 and you choose Date format, "1900-04-09" will be displayed in the cell which is 100 days after 30st December 1899. This starting date is two days early as it was a bug in Lotus 123 and then it stayed that way in Excel in order to keep compatibility. Few people will need to calculate from 1st January 1900 anyway and adding 9 days to 1st November 2000 for example will give you 10th November 2000 so all normal calculations on dates are correct.

SSDs are mechanically more robust than HDDs and suffer much less on that front when they are plugged into the computer. But since they are mostly mobile devices, their exposure to drops, accidents and electrostatic discharges is much higher. So, for different reasons, SDDs are as likely to fail if not more than hard drives. Add the danger of theft and longevity and limited capacity, and SDDs will become prohibitive as permanent data storage devices.

In many aspects, a comfortable way of Profiling is using & cachegrind; or & callgrind;, which are simulators using the runtime instrumentation framework & valgrind;. Because there is no need to access hardware counters (often difficult with today's & Linux; installations), and binaries to be profiled can be left unmodified, it is a good alternative to other profiling tools. The disadvantage of simulation - slowdown - can be reduced by doing the simulation on only the interesting program parts, and perhaps only on a few iterations of a loop. Without measurement/ simulation instrumentation, & valgrind; 's usage only has a slowdown factor in the range of 3 to 5. Also, when only the call graph and call counts are of interest, the cache simulator can be switched off.

Konqueror Plugins The Konqueror web browser can use Netscape plugins to show special content, just like the Navigator does. Please note that the way you have to install Netscape plugins may depend on your distribution. A typical place to install them is, for example, '/ opt/ netscape/ plugins'.
Associations can have a role that specifies the purpose of the association and can be uni- or bidirectional (indicates if the two objects participating in the relationship can send messages to the other, of if only one of them knows about the other).

Since & kdm; must run before any user is logged in, it is not associated with any particular user. Therefore, it is not possible to have user-specific configuration files; all users share the common & kdmrc;. It follows from this that the configuration of & kdm; can only be altered by those users that have write access to $KDEDIR / share/ config/ kdm/ kdmrc (normally restricted to system administrators logged in as root).

Note that we have checked the disconnected IMAP type account. This has the effect that a copy of the groupware data is stored locally to the client (under the home folder), and it is synchronized every time the client connects. This seems very inefficient, since your data is duplicated many times (ie; if you have 10 users that use & kontact;, you have 10+1 times the data), but it is the only way to make things run fast, because at every connection & kontact; has to fetch all data and have & korganizer; and & kaddressbook; interpret it. If you use disconnected IMAP data is cached locally, and only the delta (ie; the data that has changed) is sent.

Although there are a lot of insecure SMB networks out there which allow access to anyone, in principle you have to authenticate yourself to access the services of an SMB server. By default, & kde; will use the data entered in the Default user name and Default password fields to authenticate itself on SMB hosts. If you leave the field Default user name empty, & kde; will try to access SMB hosts without a username. If you leave the default password empty, it will try without a password. If & kde; is unsuccessful accessing the host using these settings, you will be asked for a username and a password.

You can, however, add additional SBD filters to solve certain problems. For example, as of February 2005, the Polish Festival voice has the annoying attribute of speaking sentence punctuation. It will speak the periods at the end of each sentence, for instance. You cannot solve this problem by creating a String Replacer filter to remove the sentence punctuation, because doing so will prevent the Standard SBD from recognizing any sentences. Instead, you can create a modified version of the Standard SBD that recognizes sentences while simultaneously removing the sentence punctuation. To do this, add an SBD filter and use the Load button to load the polish_festival_sbdrc file that comes with & ktts;.

During startup KDE needs to perform a check of its system configuration (mimetypes, installed applications, etc.), and in case the configuration has changed since the last time, the system configuration cache (KSyCoCa) needs to be updated. This option delays the check, which avoid scanning all directories containing files describing the system during KDE startup, thus making KDE startup faster. However, in the rare case the system configuration has changed since the last time, and the change is needed before this delayed check takes place, this option may lead to various problems (missing applications in the K Menu, reports from applications about missing required mimetypes, etc.). Changes of system configuration mostly happen by (un)installing applications. It is therefore recommended to turn this option temporarily off while (un)installing applications.

Gopher is an Internet information browsing service that uses a menu-driven interface. Users select information from menus, which may return another menu or display a text file. An item may reside on a Gopher server you originally queried, or it may be on another Gopher server (or another host). Gopher can tunnel from one Gopher to another without the user knowing that the server and/ or host machine have changed. Gopher keeps the exact location of computers hidden from the user, providing the illusion of a single, large set of interconnected menus.

The Aspect Ratio Crop tool goes further. While you are editing digital images, it is often necessary to create a compatible format with, for example, your photo album or paper formats. If you print an image from your digital camera and then try to put it in your photo album, you may notice that the camera has a different width or height ratio than a normal photographic film format so you need to crop your digital images in a predefined ratio (for example 5:7 or 2:3 which is a standard photo ratio).

A common error you may encounter when committing is Up-to-date check failed. This indicates that someone has committed changes to the repository since you last updated; or, more technically, that your BASE revision is not the newest on its branch. In such a case, & CVS; refuses to merge your modifications into the repository. The solution is to update, resolve any conflicts and commit again. Of course, if you are working on a software project, it is normally good style to check if the program still works after you have updated - after all, there could be bad interactions between your modifications and the other modifications which break the code.

The process of UBV photometry involves using light sensitive devices (such as film or CCD cameras) and aiming a telescope at a star to measure the intensity of light that passes through each of the filters individually. This procedure gives three apparent brightnesses or fluxes (amount of energy per cm^2 per second) designated by Fu, Fb, and Fv. The ratio of fluxes Fu/ Fb and Fb/ Fv is a quantitative measure of the star's "color", and these ratios can be used to establish a temperature scale for stars. Generally speaking, the larger the Fu/ Fb and Fb/ Fv ratios of a star, the hotter its surface temperature.

If you check this box, only the first letter will be written if the letter is found in several places in the word. Then you have to rechoose the same letter, to replace the second instance in the word until there are no more instances of this letter. For example, the word to guess is "potato". If this option is unchecked, when you try "o", the two instances of "o" in the word will be discovered at the same time. If this is checked, you will need to try "o" twice. Default is that for one letter typed, all instances of that letter in the word are discovered.

A ranking systematic is implemented in & digikam; by the 5 star rating tool. In fact there are 6 levels, zero through five stars (*) can be attributed (when saving them into IPTC metadata a translation of levels ensures compatibility with other programs). Rating is rapidly applied with & digikam; using keyboard shortcuts or the mouse on single photographs or whole selections. The rating can then be entered as a search criterion or directly from the status bar quick filters. However, before you start attributing stars everywhere take a moment to establish personal criteria for ranking. Best practice is to write down your personal match of stars to some qualitative expression, that will define what you actually mean when giving 5 stars. Generally there should be much less images rated with increasing star assignment. A ratio of 3-10 between each level has proven useful. That will get you quite far in distinguishing your rating pyramid. Say, you choose a ratio of 7 between levels. For every 5 star image you'll then have 7 4 stars, 49 3 stars and so on, resulting in almost 20000 pictures. Amazing? Yes, and 16807 of them you did n't have to rate at all! You even can define a different rating scheme depending on the kind of use, 2 stars for commercial use, may mean something else than 2 stars holiday photos. It is also a good practice to define a neutral rating, everything below is actually a negative rating. This will help you culling and thinning your collection very efficiently.

If you check this option, any files in your desktop directory that begin with a period (.) will be shown. Usually, such files contain configuration information, and remain hidden from view. For example, files which are named ". directory" are plain text files which contain information for Konqueror, such as the icon to use in displaying a directory, the order in which files should be sorted, etc. You should not change or delete these files unless you know what you are doing.
The part starting with / holds summary information about the melds. This makes it easier to write some regular expressions. Every meld is represented by four characters. The first character is one out of sbcdwSBCDW, again lowercase for exposed and uppercase for concealed. The second character is a number saying how many tiles the meld holds. This is 1 up to 4 for a kong. The 0 is used for a chow. The last two characters hold the value of this meld.

With this tool you can work on the perspective in a photograph. This is very useful when working with photographs that contain keystone distortion. Keystone distortion occurs when an object is photographed from an angle rather than from a straight-on view. For example, if you take an image of a tall building from ground level, the edges of the building appear to meet each other at the far end. On the other hand you can use this tool to introduce a new perspective that is not a face-on view but to give the image a creative spin.
You can reorder the list at any time by & LMB; clicking on the column header. This will first sort the files in ascending order based on the contents of that column. If you & LMB; click again on the same header, the files will be re-sorted in descending order.

There are multiple ways of measuring the pH value of a solution, one of which is to use indicator paper. Indicator paper changes color depending on the pH of the solution applied to it, and by comparing to a chart a fairly accurate measure of the solution's pH can be obtained. If a more accurate measure is needed, a glass electrode can be used, which works by measuring the conductivity of the solution.

When off, the insertion cursor cannot be moved left of the line start, but it can be moved off the line end, which can be very handy for programmers. When this option is chosen, moving the cursor with the arrow keys off the end of a line (to the right) causes it to jump down to the beginning of the next line. Likewise when the cursor is moved past the beginning of a line (to the left) it jumps up to the end of the preceding line. When this option is not selected, moving the cursor right past the end of a line merely causes it to continue horizontally in the same line and trying to move it left past the beginning does nothing.

Another phenomenon that suggested the need for dark matter is the rotational curves of Spiral Galaxies. Spiral Galaxies contain a large population of stars that orbit the Galactic center on nearly circular orbits, much like planets orbit a star. Like planetary orbits, stars with larger galactic orbits are expected to have slower orbital speeds (this is just a statement of Kepler's 3rd Law). Actually, Kepler's 3rd Law only applies to stars near the perimeter of a Spiral Galaxy, because it assumes the mass enclosed by the orbit to be constant.

If you are using an Overhead projector, learn how to use it beforehand. Make sure that the bulb works, that the spare bulb is still okay. Clean the lens and display plates. If you are not used to working with projectors, practice. Ensure that the projection screen itself is clean. It's probably best, when timing yourself, to allow for five seconds (count one thousand and one, one thousand and two....) to change each slide. That way you know you do n't have to rush. If you need to point at something on a slide, you can use a pointer and point at the display screen, find a laser pointer or put a pencil on the transparency itself. Be warned, these tend to roll out of place when you nudge the table.
