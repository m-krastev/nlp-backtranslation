A loan is an agreement in which a borrower receives money from a lender and agrees to repay the money at a later date. & kappname; allows you to track loans where you are the lender yourself and have lent money, or you, as a borrower, have taken out a loan. Most individuals take out loans rather than to lend money, so in general you are the borrower, and a financial institution the lenders. If you lend money to a family member or friend, you can of course use & kappname; to do this.

Usually you get new certificates by checking signatures in mail messages, because the certificates are usually embedded in the signatures made with them. However, if you want to send a message to someone you have not had contact with before, then you have to fetch the certificate from an LDAP folder (gpgsm; can also do that automatically for you) or a file.
