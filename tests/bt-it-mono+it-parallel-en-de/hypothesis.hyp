The audio quality of Vorbis is better not measured in kilobits per second, but on a quality scale of -1 to 10. Quality -1 corresponds to approximately 45 kbps, 5 is approximately 160 kbps, and 10 yields in approximately 400 kbps. CD-close quality is approximately achieved at level 5, lossless stereo compression is approximately achieved at level 6. The default is 3, with that you reach approximately 110 kbps and much smaller files at better quality than.mp3 with 12kbps.

A loan is an agreement where a borrower receives money from a lender and agrees to repay the money at a later date. & kappname; allows you to track loans where you are the lender yourself and have lent money or you, as the borrower, have taken out a loan. Most private individuals take out loans rather than to lend money, so you are basically the borrower and a financial institution the lenders. When you lend money to a family member or friend you can of course use & kappname; for this purpose.

What is Instant Messaging (im;)? & im; is a form of communication with friends over the Internet. It sounds a lot like e-mail, but even a short e-mail conversation can be exhausting.

With & im;, the conversation is just as fluid as it is with a phone or a personal conversation. The messages are entered into a shared window in the form.
