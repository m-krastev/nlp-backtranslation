Vorbis' audio quality is better measured not in kilobits per second, but on a quality scale of -1 to 10. Quality -1 equals approximately 45 KBit / s., 5 is approximately 160 KBit / s., and 10 yields in approximately 400 KBits / s. CD-near quality is achieved approximately at Level 5. Lossless stereo compression is achieved approximately at Level 6. The default is 3, thus you achieve approximately 110 KBit / s., and substantially smaller files at better quality than.mp3 with 122
