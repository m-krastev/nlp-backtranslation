The audio quality of Vorbis is better measured not in kilobits per second, but on a quality scale of -1 to 10. Quality -1 corresponds to about 45 kbps, 5 is about 160 kbps and 10 yields about 400 kbps. CD-close quality is achieved at about level 5, lossless stereo compression is achieved at about level 6. The default is 3, which gives you about 110 kbps and much smaller files at better quality than.mp3 with 128 kbps. This explanation was copied from the FAQ at www.vorbis.com.
