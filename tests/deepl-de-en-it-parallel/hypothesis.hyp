The audio quality of vorbis is better measured not in kilobits per second, but on a quality scale of -1 to 10. Quality -1 equals approximately 45 kbps., 5 is approximately 160 kbps., and 10 equals approximately 400 kbps. CD-close quality is approximately reached at step 5. Lossless stereo compression is achieved approximately at step 6. Default is 3, so you reach approximately 110 kbps., and much smaller files at better quality than.mp3 with 12kbps.
