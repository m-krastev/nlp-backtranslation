Here you can enter the infinitive of the spanish verb and its meaning in the foreign language. It is important that you tell the program if the verb is regular or one of the spanish group verbs or irregular. If it is irregular, you must enter the irregular forms as well.

What is it about instant messaging (im;)? & im; is a form of communication with friends over the Internet. This sounds similar to email, however even a short conversation by email can be exhausting in itself. You have to click on replies every time, then find the correct place in the text and finally submit the email. There is always a certain amount of time waiting for the next message to arrive. With & im; the conversation is as fluid as by telephone or in personal conversation. The messages are entered into a shared window.
