What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort nor the & quot; Bakery & quot;.
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD's ranks will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS on the Prague City Council and on the city council.
The newspaper Aktuala. cz once knocked members of the new council out of the ČSSD a little 'quot;', how they master the notorious slang that has become naturalized in the last few years, when today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary, introduced by Prague Mayor Pavel Bém's political elite in the late 19th century, is borrowed from some of Prague' s best-known actors, situations, and causae.
Surprisingly, the new councils appeared to be somewhat obscure about the terms.
Or at least they say they do.
& quot; Who Is Voldemort? & quot;
& quot; Clueless. & quot;
& quot; I am more of a novice in Prague politics & quot;, reacted Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, to the test of the & quot; godfather vocabulary & quot;.
Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar manner.
For example, to the term & quot; golf hole & quot;.
& quot; This is the only expression of the ones you put forward to me here that I use occasionally. & quot;
& quot; Otherwise, I don 't like slang very much. & quot;
The editors picked six terms from the vocabulary published by the newspaper Aktuálě. cz in June this year, ahead of the ODS Electoral Congress, mainly those notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms & quot; Voldemort & quot;, & quot; largest Prague Gulf hole & quot;, & quot; go to the Bakery & quot;, & quot; bull neck & quot;, & quot; capital & quot; betrayal & quot; bleach & quot;.
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague's education system - initially promised to participate in the interview, but did not even take the receiver.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test out of hand.
& quot; These things matter to me, and how the Civic Democrats talk to each other, I do not judge. & quot;
& quot; For me, the important thing is how we understand each other in our programs, 'he countered.
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the aforementioned headline that he was talking about the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term & quot; Voldemort & quot; tells Kaucky absolutely nothing and the only word he correctly guessed at the test was & quot; the largest Prague golf hole & quot;.
& quot; This is the tunnel Blanka & quot;, Kauck says, but adds for safety: & quot; But I know this more from the newspaper. & quot;
And jokingly: & quot; I will probably have to take a language course. & quot;
The & quot; Golfloch & quot; will be correctly deciphered as Tunnel Blanka by Matador Karel Březina and Lukáš Plachý, the Councillor for the Environment.
Both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even guesses where the figure is to be found, and thus what it means to go & quot; in the confectionery.
& quot; I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy & quot;, Plachy is pretty close to solving the puzzle, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he professes to have drawn his knowledge more from the newspaper than from his own vocabulary.
Judging by the participants in the test, there does not seem to be any similar naturalized slang among the social democrats.
& quot; I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing here. & quot;
& quot; We call each other by name, sometimes we use abbreviations or nicknames & quot;, says Prague ČSSD Chairman Petr Hulínský - nicknamed & quot; Hulda & quot; by his fellow-politicians.
& quot; At school, I was called Bříza (Birch), but I don 't know if my colleagues call me like that, Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
Deník Aktuale. cz tried out the name and see - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the & quot; grandpa & quot; to the party members, or less friendly to the & quot; Old & quot;;; the representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention before the elections by machinations in the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues & quot; Igráček & quot; (well-known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are the only thing permitted by the Social Democrats in internal party parlance.
Hulínsky is said to dislike being called & quot; Hulda & quot; but Deník Aktuálně. cz registered another nickname for the Prague chairman.
His nickname & quot; Doctor of the rubber truncheon right & quot; is said to have got to do with the fact that Petr Hulínsky earned his title Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop torturing witches & quot; and has published a brochure
Women who are labeled as witches in Burkina Faso generally share some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to be of the older generation, unable to find work - for health reasons, for example, they are single and do not have children.
When one of these women becomes a witch & quot;, she is kept strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
Men are rarely affected by this fate. & quot;
& quot; Also young and healthy women are spared, because they help with work and bear children. & quot; describes the situation, a nun takes care of more than one hundred women, who have been expelled from their communities, in a special home in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso.
The local government decided to take action against this abnormal & quot; social measure.
And for this reason, it published a booklet aimed at preventing the & quot; witch hunt.
There is, however, a catch to this.
& quot; More than 70% of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read & quot; pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment to & quot; of the Standard & quot; newspaper.
Accusing him of witchcraft is common practice in other African countries, too.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbor, Ammy Hemmahova, 27, was tortured to death - doused in kerosene and then set alight - by three women and two men.
The incident was reported by the BBC.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the thing was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil was inflamed and used for ritual anointing.
This happened after the group tried to 'quot;' drive an evil spirit out of the woman 'quot;'.
The isolation of & quot; witches & quot; supports the people here, regardless of their education.
& quot; The Standard & quot; quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human souls are a hazard & quot;," he said.
While the Burkina Faso government is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the President of The Gambia, the President himself, got a lot of play.
& quot; President Yahya Jammeh unleashed a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt died, claiming that her aunt was complicit in her death and that she would try to kill the president herself by black magic.
& quot; To this end, he called on the help of shamans from neighbouring Guinea, who, accompanied by the president's police, soldiers, and bodyguards, kidnapped indiscriminately women and men from Gambian villages and took them to the president' s farm in Kanilai. '
On the farm, the imprisoned were forced to drink a decoction made from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but it also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the trapped people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: he heats in the oven, but he pays a higher rent
An elderly stocky man is leaving the client centre of RPG Byty, owned by & quot; coal baron & quot; Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental housing in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a folder containing three new leases for three apartments: his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving his sentence.
All three have had their rent increased as part of the so-called & quot; deregulation.
Instead of 3500 kronor monthly rent, the son will fork out 4100 kronor for a two-bedroom apartment with a second category kitchen next year.
& quot; And there is no hot running water or heat in the apartment in a simple coal stove & quot;, he angrily points the finger at the new lease of the son, to which he has a power of attorney to sign.
& quot; But what - I signed & quot;, he explains half-upset and half-resigned.
The civic association Bytyoked. cz, which called the new lease conditions' incorrect 'and' immoral ', advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7th, when they intend to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man just waves away.
& quot; One says this, the other the & quot;, makes a somber face.
The Ostrava region will become a large & quot; deregulation laboratory.
After New Year, this deregulation will apply to most rental apartments in the Czech Republic whose tenants do not yet pay a fair rent.
Aktuálě. cz therefore decided to visit this & quot; lab & quot; in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and was packed as early as 9am on this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the security agency's bodyguards and a caller.
& quot; Rent 2011 & quot; will light up a special touch pad on the touchscreen.
Tap the button for a moment and the device spits out a numberplate.
As soon as we have deciphered the number & quot; 157 & quot;, it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it is your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room is obviously not for the new rent.
Most of the people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance stuff and the like.
From mid-November onwards, envelopes containing the new leases will be flapping in the mailboxes of most of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio in the Ostrava region.
The RPG Byty proposes a rent increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for new rentals in the Client Center has been open since November 18th.
& quot; The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning & quot;, the ladies behind the counter answer after a moment of hesitation, when the & quot; client turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' apartments are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the deputy president of the Czech Socialist Union, Lubomír Zaorálek, from Ostrava, had raised this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today's newspapers are full of it.
& quot; Twenty years I want a new floor from them. & quot;
& quot; Not even some damn toilet glasses could replace them & quot; the man mentioned above exclaims.
So far, according to the employees, mainly pensioners are waiting at the counter to see if they really get the promised tenant discount, which RPG promises to give them if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15 will also benefit from a half reduction in February rent.
For now, & quot; deregulation counter & quot; in Havířov is everything but overloaded with demand.
& quot; Only about 40-50 of yesterday's 360 clients were here because of rent in 2011, the counter clerks estimate.
RPG offers individual rentals where necessary, both on its website and on blackboards.
However, if the parties to the lease do not agree on the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
& quot; This is not meant to be a threat, but to provide information about what is the only possible and completely legitimate legal course of action, & quot; explains on its website.
& quot; Nobody goes to court here & quot; says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center agrees with her, at least partially.
& quot; I have 13,000 (kroner) in pension, of which I have 5,000 left over for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute & quot;, "he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
& quot; See for a second time. & quot;
& quot; Mr. Zaorálek tells them through the media not to sign and so people are still waiting & quot;, gives them pause.
Regulated rent will end in most of Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
& quot; The existing rent level is not enough even to maintain the housing fund, argues Pavel Klime, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty. - The neglect of the housing fund, criticized by angry tenants, is according to the landlords the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion dollars from the collected rents in apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to invest 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room in Havířov, some red information keeps appearing.
& quot; The rent increase in 2011 of 15% or less affects 31,200 apartments, more than 90% of the apartments of RPG.
& quot; Always means maximum CZK 7.50 per square meter and month & quot; read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
& quot; These cases are about raising extremely low rents of CZK 19.66 per square meter & quot;, argues RPG.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent stays the same for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not push rents up sharply, but will happen gradually over a period of four to eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation on itself: all the income from the rent increase (see chart), the company wants to re-invest in the apartments, mainly in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - primarily, these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw - the office includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with all that goes with it: colourful walls, creative furniture, lots of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch. Design since last year.
From the very beginning, the design and architecture firm Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole series of famous Brno buildings originated, calculated the premises for its company mini-kindergarten as the initial designs for the new Avriopoint building.
Wisely prescient, because most of the 90 employees are baby boomers, and the company is keen to get the project developers back to work as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch. Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
Construction engineers and architects will find it easier to reconcile their demanding profession and child care.
The mini-kindergarten was originally conceived by the staff of Arch. Design and with the support of the management, they managed to get funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten will be financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting to CZK 2.8 million), the necessary equipment and equipment could be procured and for a period of two years qualified personnel and operations were provided.
After exhaustion of subsidies (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue running the mini-kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of the application.
The children are looked after full-time by qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher. Children can visit the kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And because this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children can be present at the same time. However, several children take turns during the day.
The kindergarten is operated flexibly according to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights regarding the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting program of pre-school education.
Children not only play here, they also get excellent teaching - from basic knowledge to pre-school instruction, and they also learn English on the side.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a calculator that is available to the children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can always have a look at the children, thus avoiding the stress of picking up the children late from a kindergarten far away.
Parents are therefore using their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relations develop here too.
Arch. Design was thus placed among Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family friendly and strengthen their HR marketing through such programs.
A bone house is still fascinating after 100 years. See Gaudi's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs are like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are open fish mouths.
This is Casa Batlló, designed by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house, with its organic forms, was nicknamed '& quot; Bonehead' by locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splinters and mosaics, the shed-like façades and the ubiquitous soft lines are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures that remind of nature and living beings.
Only on closer inspection does one realize that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and elaborate order.
At night, the whole façade becomes even more vivid and dramatic, and the special illumination adds to the brightness of the colours.
The same sweeping lines and sinuous shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Waving wood copies the window frames, railings, door decorations, even peepholes and moldings.
The Batlló house, in the Eixample district, on the lively Passeig de Grácia Nr. 43, was created by the conversion of a house from 1877, carried out by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of an entirely new one, but finally he agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper renovation.
The Casa Batlló apartment building was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked together with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on the drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the reality were made, and his idea was also to use mosaics on the façade.
Numerous other artists and artists also contributed to the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudí's house Casa Milá in Güell Park, which is also home to other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed 'bone house' by locals for its organic shapes.
Others called it 'yawning house' because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building there is a picture of the Sword of Saint George, the Patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a central heating system for the house, unique for the time, with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degree inclination seems somewhat bizarre.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all building regulations of the time and was not deterred by these at all.
Before construction began, he obtained planning permission from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that when it was completed two years later, the city fathers were so shocked by the result that they demanded remedial action.
Councillors also clashed over the fact that the building, with its piers, even interfered with the public sidewalk.
There was no change, quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the neighbourhood requested it, Josep Batlló applied for permission to let the two highest floors of the house - and was promptly granted it.
The owner of the house himself moved to the lower floors.
The gallery on the second floor had a parlour, while the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment were on the third floor.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building is lined with stairs leading up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of the interconnection of rooms.
The social aspect can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, allowing a larger group to chat comfortably, without sacrificing a certain intimacy in more intimate conversations.
The house was renovated by Gaudí and, in addition to a new façade, acquired a rather unusual roof and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play with light is equally impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles covering the courtyard and the atriums.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house the maximum amount of light.
In doing so, he simply applied the principle that white reflects light better than dark colours, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, inscribed in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, is now open to the public.
On the first floor, the spatial and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year to celebrate the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was determined that this was a fairly profitable business, the tours were retained, and extended to other common rooms as well as the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
The price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16,50 Euro. Students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist identification get 20 percent reduction.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its little dragon turrets, try to make friends with one of the residents of the house and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
These must, however, harmoniously complement each other in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the sleeper's weight, height, state of health, and last but not least the sleeper' s sex.
The interior, in which the mattress and the rust have to be subordinated, is just as important.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not suitable because they take much longer to warm.
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the core and are lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is not impossible that mould will develop underneath them.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the choice of course.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, it is difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
& quot; Probably all hockey players who came back from the NHL complained to me that they could not sleep properly anymore. & quot;
& quot; For their shoulders, heels, and hips, they simply need a soft layer of Visco foam (Memory Foam). & quot;
& quot; This is one of the things I recommend to people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, which makes it difficult for them to get the & quot; information from the joints and skin, 'explains Sylva Hadamczikova, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why I bought Visco Memory Foam from many hockey players and other customers many years ago.
& quot; Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among others the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico. & quot;
And you don 't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of Visco foam.
This miracle & quot; actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally hugs the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you do not roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also protects against decubitus (gangrene).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles of the feet to the height of the mattress, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are about 180 cm tall, need a bed that is 210 to 220 cm long.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm lying width available, that is 180 cm together.
For single beds, for example singles, there are 120 to 140 cm spaces.
For the sake of convenience, and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed size: & quot; if you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly bent arms & quot;, advises Helena Prokopová, engineer of the guild of upholsterers and decorators, who has been working on the problematic of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years now and who also lectures on this topic at technical colleges.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, all you have left is to assemble the grates at different heights, which is far from being possible on every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be used for the mould and the fine cushion.
& quot; Do not feel the feathers when you sit down or with your hand, warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of grating.
Fully pillowy beds with mattress and mattress, like Siamese twins growing together, have no purpose in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is common practice today.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 liters of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will slowly become a huge (and clogged) sieve.
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a life of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Each thing has its ifs and buts.
And here's some practical advice from the seller: For mattresses that are 120 or 140 cm in width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is recommended to use a mattress protector that can be easily peeled off and washed.
Even though today's mattress covers are usually zipped so that you get two halves when opened (incredibly important for washing and machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often feels like the unequal match between David and Goliath.
Do you have a solid plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get Me Out Of Here!
Or at most one bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also, you should add ventilation holes to the board (if there are any) and use mattresses with spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring core and fine cushion.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-adjustable slats with 14 to 18 slats (slats) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (possibly also combinations of latex and coco), whereby slats with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 or more slats, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebra area and the possibility of adjusting the slats hardness.
Adjustable slats do not include mattresses with spring skeleton because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the pin strips, special flexible shoulder modules are offered.
This involves a special attachment for the connectors, which allows the connectors to be inserted or twisted in such a way that they allow the sleeper's shoulder to sink in at certain points.
Especially for wide-shouldered men.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft areas for the shoulders at & quot; Mattresses.
There is also a special emphasis on ladies - they are treated to the soft areas in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing springs (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsional springs are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing the stress.
But - if you use a bad (too big and stuffy) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the benefits are lost.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, a 50 x 60 cm cushion, as the Scandinavians like it, appears.
In the lateral position, the cushion should balance shoulder height (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress).
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former straw bags (filled with hay) nevertheless.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
For mattresses, too, the new magic word is & quot; Bio & quot;.
Instead of crude oil, natural oils - such as castor oil and soybean oil - are increasingly being used to make polyurethane foams.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
& quot; Bio means, in the case of mattresses, that their core is made of materials of purely natural origin, explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
You can also treat yourself to microcapsules that exude the scent of fresh forest or lavender when you sleep.
Again, there is a difference between a man and a woman.
For men, a & quot; cooling & quot; plant extract from birch leaves is used to allow the mattress cover to absorb the heat and cool the body, while for women, & quot; has a warming & quot; effect.
Red pepper extracts stimulate blood circulation, helping the weaker sex get pleasantly warm while sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Cold foam mattresses (they have larger pores with a damaged cell structure and are more breathable than standard polyurethane and are much more flexible).
Combining the different stiffness of cold foams and Visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where your head, hip, and heels are.
However, you have to shell out 7000 kronor or more for a quality mattress.
Health mattresses are usually subject to less VAT because they are considered to be a medical resource.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to be granted this benefit.
You can see that saving on the mattress and on the rust is not that easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and distributors who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers the Duofreeze mattress with Visco Quilted Foam Memory for CZK 11,990.
You can add the second one for free.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density, at an almost cosmic pace.
It is no wonder, since they were designed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloading during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft when heated, but solidifies in a cool environment.
This allows it to adapt perfectly to the human body and optimally distribute the body's pressure.
This makes it not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but also generally improves sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot pads, which are supposed to relieve the legs and the vessels.
Local manufacturers use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to keep kids under control
Fear for one's children is mounting, and more and more parents are considering monitoring them using GPS.
The system, originally invented to track cars, can actually locate people, which would be useful in cases like the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatkova.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet, but soon it will probably not be any bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have been terrified by the disappearance of Anička, and they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the price of compromising your privacy.
& quot; We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective way to reduce the likelihood of tragedy, says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil Company, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
& quot; I acknowledge that there may be misuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, when someone puts it in their pocket without knowing it, but we have not had any such cases. & quot;
& quot; Most customers really buy it for security reasons, 'Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what the & quot; box & quot; is for, and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, they just get rid of it.
& quot; Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things, when they do not want to be controlled. & quot;
& quot; Mobile phones were a source of great expectation for parents at the beginning, but they are just as easy to turn off as these new & quot; monitors, says Mrs Bočková.
In her opinion, it is also disputed whether such an institution really helps in case of an attack.
& quot; When kidnapping, the kidnapper virtually always checks if the child has any electronics with him or her that could be used to locate him or her.
& quot; Today it's the mobile phone. & quot;
& quot; If such monitoring devices were more widely used, they would seek them as their sale would be accompanied by massive advertising.
& quot; In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police, says the psychologist.
However, she acknowledges that similar devices can be useful in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for cars as well as individuals, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
& quot; The device can be configured to report its current position at certain intervals.
& quot; Even if it were to be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available. & quot;
& quot; For more expensive devices, there is even a built-in inclinometer, which means that if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position of the device, claims Mr Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, all you have to do is install in a special software program.
The problem with the current positioning devices is that they are either match-box sized devices that resemble trailers, or smaller phones.
There is always the danger of losing it.
According to Mr Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are currently being tested.
& quot; This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to recognize that the device is a tracking device.
& quot; Or he notices it only after a certain time, giving the police a time advantage & quot;, he adds.
Regardless of the direction of development, towards wristbands or pendants, the same technology is always used as for vehicle tracking.
This is a combination of the positioning function, used by the GPS system (as in the car navigation system), and the function of the mobile phone, which reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses you could wrap whole Czech Republic but they only last two years
The Czech Army bought 445 kilometers of fuses to be detonated with IEDs.
By the year before, the Ministry of Defence had already supplied 224 kilometres of fuse to the army camps.
It is comforting to know that the Armed Forces have been there for 225 years.
The problem is just the durability of the fuses - two years at most.
The army bought the fuses from the public company STV Group, a. s. for a paltry 40 million kronor.
In justifying the purchase of this enormous amount of fuse, the general staff of MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume about 60 kilometers of fuse each year.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians brought to the attention of MF DNES, this information indicates that the whole army has to undertake an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year - from all the generals and officers of the army command to the secretaries and cleaners.
Not exempt Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek.
Only in this way can we halfway justify the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition.
By the way, this length corresponds to 25.000 detonations.
Even so, these army stocks would be sufficient for more than ten years.
But if the old expert rule is still valid that only two meters of fuse is enough to train each new professional soldier, then the army has built up a reassuring stock for the 225 years that have already been mentioned, even in view of the increased needs of the pioneering and special forces.
Soldiers from the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to Defense Minister Vondra that they almost ran out of small arms cartridges, so shooting drills are severely limited due to lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
& quot; Nor do I see why they buy such huge amounts of ignition fuses from us.
But at the end of the day this is your decision, you will know what you need it for.
& quot; For us, the army is a good customer and we as a retailer want to help it as much as possible, says Jan Děcký, Sales Manager for STV Group.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of fuse by saying that the army would have been stocking up with this & quot; ammunition for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group only talks about a four-year service life of the fuses, and police and army pyrotechnicians only talk about two years.
& quot; With perfect storage, the four years mentioned could be & quot; admits one of the guys, who wishes to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army as a soldier.
After the end of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see whether it is still reliable and whether it does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free of charge, they cost additional money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometer fuse.
& quot; They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers, spokesman Pejšek tells us about the viewpoint of the buyers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison, the annual consumption of fuses used by police pyrotechnicians to liquidate ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brotherly Army has barely exceeded 1,500 metres for some years.
And the police only ever order those quantities of ammunition which they can consume before the end of their useful life.
Already for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, besides, one keeps open the possibility for flexible purchases of modern and thus also reliable ignition lines.
The Ministry of Defence has huge problems in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, when the Czechoslovakia's two hundred thousand strong army was preparing to go on a campaign along the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians mentioned by MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces will have the same problem with the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old fuses, which they bought so cheaply today.
To this day, the contacts I have won thanks to the competition come to my mind.
The winning placement in the & quot; Small Businessman of the Year & quot; competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
Last year's winner of the & quot; Small Entrepreneur of the Year & quot; competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked travelling.
It was only abroad that he realised that Liberec lacked good accommodation facilities at reasonable prices.
Using savings from his holidays abroad and a bank loan, he bought a ramshackle house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-grade college student at the time, this was certainly a bold move.
& quot; The price-quality ratio annoyed me at the time, so I tried to do something about it, says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented out his first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profits back into the house, which he then converted step-by-step into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity, he has opened four boarding houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the 4-star Hotel & quot; Pytloun Design Hotel & quot;.
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
& quot; We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties in the Pytloun franchise have already contacted us, "says the entrepreneur number one last year.
& quot; Entrepreneur of the Year Award just won the big prize for selling the licensed business to run hotels, "adds Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater prominence, even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
& quot; People recognized me in the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say, that was really good & quot;, "he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this contest.
You don 't need to win immediately, every visibility is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise have never come to pass.
& quot; I still maintain regular business relationships with some of the people I met through the competition. & quot;
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also has a little effect on each of his employees.
And since he has close to seventy.
& quot; I notice more loyalty and pride in being part of something that gets universal recognition. & quot;
I really do not consider this only as a personal success, no, it's the result of good work done by all of us. & quot;
& quot; My name has only become slightly prominent & quot;, Lukáš Pytloun says humbly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the aftermath of the crisis.
Farmet has come through the worst of it thanks to his determination.
The first place prize in last year's Vodafone Company of the Year competition was won by Karel Žďárský, Farmet' s owner.
The jury appreciated at the time the efforts with which he rammed from the small tool shop in Česká Skalice a company, which makes hundreds of millions turnover.
& quot; I can say that this award emboldened not only myself, but all my employees as well and strengthened our self-confidence in the competition & quot;, says the last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, there was an effort to do something useful.
When the state offered his father, Karel Žďársky, a small workshop for rent, in exchange for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate, giving up his career in the company where he had worked to start his own plastic tub-making company with a few of his father's comrades.
A short time later, they started to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that she entered the consciousness of the non-professional public.
& quot; Not only did our customers perceive the Farmet brand more intensively, but our foreign partners began to appreciate the fact that we could cooperate with a company that had achieved the greatest success in their country, says Karel Žďárský.
The past year was not only marked by victory euphoria for Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's financial results for 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 in particular was the most difficult year for tool sales.
The crisis, which was then even more of a shock to the citizens, but mainly to businesses, was at its height - many firms were forced to stop investing and to restrict the purchasing of new equipment and technologies.
& quot; Of course, we could not escape this situation. & quot;
& quot; Sales fell by 40%, we had to cut production and even lay-offs, explains Karel Žďárský
A viable business must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get to grips with the situation and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to compromise on investment in research and development.
& quot; From the grant we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions & quot;, says Žďársky.
Everything testifies to the fact that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
& quot; I wish the new victor much joy in winning - but in a quieter atmosphere & quot;, Karel Žďárský will host.
An Opinion Poll That Cleans Up Nonsensical Rules
The Quot; Absurdity of the Year poll is part of the entrepreneurship competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical rules have already succeeded in getting rid of each other.
The dubious winner of next year's & quot; Absurdity of the Year poll was the requirement to create documents available online.
Thus decided more than one third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs.
The Social Security Administration requested a paper statement from the trade register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two clicks of the mouse.
Now, thanks to the poll, that is changing.
Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register for checks on social security payers, ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová said.
The whole point of the & quot; Opinion Survey of Absurdity of the Year is to scrutinise all the regulations and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that the competition has been organised by the Czech Business Newspaper (HN), which is enjoying increasing popularity among the general public.
If there were around three thousand people voting last year, there were four thousand this year.
Not surprising, since there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only to hinder the activity of the company.
& quot; For example, in terms of the number of income tax forms, we rank first in the world, notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses and Businessmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurship has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company conditions, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in 2003 and takes place in the same scenario every year.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the close of the competition at the end of September.
Registration is open at www.firmaroku.cz. After that, the competition organizer will select seven candidates for the & quot; Antipreis & quot; and will let the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.hned. cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins out.
More than one hundred, more specifically 105 useless rules and regulations have already been notified to this year's public opinion survey.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated & quot; finalists & quot; of the competition are for example the requirements that maintenance vehicles for highways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to install every two years.
The list of this year's & quot; Seven & quot; has been published on the competition pages.
The proclamation of the competition in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of a happening regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, as well as Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Republic Chamber of Commerce participated in the highlight of the competition.
& quot; Where the state throws cudgels at entrepreneurs, there cannot be a real economic recovery, so my goal is to repeal at least thirty articles every year, which today make it even more difficult for entrepreneurs to do business, said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical orders are having an effect.
In 2007, people were most disturbed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to notify the Trade Office at the site of their permanent establishment three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or fair with a booth.
This obligation was abolished as a result of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The requirement, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to notify the employment office of business trips by employees of up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so-called "& quot; Green Card."
And - all good things come in threes:
The absurdity of 2009 was the ordinance that required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator, and two bathroom scales in the consulting room.
The regulation was somewhat toned down by the Department of Health this year - the requirement to keep a fridge in the fridge was dropped.
A New Category Honors Socially Responsible Companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian projects, environmental projects, educational projects or sports projects
A novelty in this year's competition, now in its fifth year, is the & quot; Responsible Company of the Year 2010 & quot; category.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair enterprises.
& quot; We want to support companies that are aware of the environmental impact of their business activities and support socially responsible initiatives & quot; says Patrik Bartholdy, Regional Manager of Vodafone, who is the caller and guarantor of this competition as well as of the & quot; Rebel of the Year.
This year, the first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year, registered companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is highly inspirational, and there is enough material for a stand-alone article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject of their activity, their efforts have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about gehandicapte humans, there about personal problems or the health of your own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, there was the Prague software company Et Netera, which encourages the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a handicapped children's trust for seventeen years now.
Also a paper mill from Poděbrady takes an exemplary care of its health handicapped employees, who make up 70% of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title & quot; Responsible Company of the Region Central Bohemia & quot;; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it came third in this region.
The Olomouc region was won by MiRyz Soft, an accounting firm, which introduced fluent working hours, which were also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in wages.
The jury also appreciated the fact that the company mainly shopped for Czech manufacturers, supported citizens' initiatives in its environment and worked according to environmentally friendly principles.
& quot; We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimize the impact of our business activities and administration on the environment, explains its CEO, Miluse Ryznarova.
Enlogit, a responsible IT company based in Ústí nad Labem, is concerned about the health of its employees. It has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, encourages homework among its employees, and uses cartering services provided by a local protected workshop for corporate events.
& quot; In addition, we support the & quot; Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community, "says Ondrej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company & quot; Praní a čištění & quot; from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, as it contributes to its pension insurance scheme in the form of extra bonuses to its employees.
& quot; We give our employees contributions for food, transport, qualifications and holidays, says Josef Strapáč from Czasch construction company in Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
All district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically entered into the Responsible Company of the Year category. They would answer the questions listed in the questionnaire accompanying the registration and send it to the organizer no later than August 15th.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
& quot; If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the & quot; Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they were not disqualified in the main Vodafone Company of the Year competition. & quot;
& quot; It is not possible to register separately only for this competition because it is only a sub-category of the main competition Company of the Year & quot;, explains Karel Goldman of Bison & amp; Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Police arrests in public tender
In the last few days, anti-corruption police have made arrests at the Soil Fund building in Pilsen.
In the process, Luboš G., a local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer, was led away in handcuffs by detectives.
The latter allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition for settlement of restitution claims so that the properties offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party.
The latter allegedly paid Luboš G. half a million.
& quot; At this time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the crime of fraud in a public competition & quot; Antonie Zelená, chief of the prosecution of Pilsen, told the paper & quot; that she could not give any further details regarding the ongoing investigation.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by police.
How he was able to manipulate the public competition, one can only speculate, given the sparse official information.
The spokeswoman of the Soil Fund Lubomír Černá stated that in the Pilsen branch of the Soil Fund the police did in fact make arrests during a public competition.
& quot; It was about a client and it was not about one of our employees,'she explained.
The public competition, according to Ms. Černá, had the correct name & quot; Request for Bids for Translocation of Land under the Soil Act & quot; and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the offered land.
& quot; These persons offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value. & quot;
& quot; The order of the potential buyers is determined according to the claims offered, and then the Soil Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer, explains the spokeswoman of the Fund.
Luboš G. obviously had information available about who had logged in at the request, and since he was himself a legitimate person, having bought a series of restitution claims, he offered a property interest to withdraw from the competition.
Evidently against a fat severance payment.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large sum of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already in the past too good contacts to the Pilsner soil fund.
He also played a role in the case of Václav Sankota, the former head of the Soil Fund. Sankota was prosecuted for issuing land in substitute restitutions for which site decisions had already been taken on construction projects.
For example, Luboš G. purchased land from the Land Fund that was intended to be used to build public roads, specifically where the access road to the Borské pole industrial estate was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the properties far.
The town hall had to give up small donations with a heavy heart in order not to jeopardize the building project by blocking the properties.
The cost of housing in households is rising by a few hundred per month
Households will not only have to face higher costs for all types of energy from January onwards, but they will also have to pay higher water and sewage charges, as well as rent for district heating and in some places.
Families will have to withdraw several hundred kronor more from their wallets every month from January onwards than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas 2 percent more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places district heating will become more expensive.
The cost of electricity alone is several hundred kronor more per year for households.
High electricity prices have been reduced by all main suppliers, which is to blame for the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic installations.
Gas will only become moderately more expensive, but only when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Again, a few hundred kronor more per year is expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Especially larger sites that plan to increase prices.
For example, from January households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kronor more per month for district heating, while families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 kronor more per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, face 9% higher water and sewage charges if the city increases the infrastructure rent.
Unless the rent changes, it is only 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague remains among the lowest in the whole Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges will increase by 7.4 percent.
Huge increases in rents are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, for which the so-called rent regulation will cease to apply from January.
For example, housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100 percent starting in January.
If you do not agree to this rent increase, the company will take you to court.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it seems just too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once also a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under the age of fifteen most often need emergency treatment.
Children who repeatedly need to sleep off their hangovers in hospital are no exception.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who have experienced similar situations in the reception of children's departments of clinics.
& quot; beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it simply takes too long to get drunk. & quot;
& quot; Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol & quot;, said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief physician of the pediatric department of the Central Bohemian clinic Hořovice.
& quot; Whisky, if you can steal a bottle from your father's house bar, and if you can't, at least Fernet or Vodka.
& quot; Vodka has the advantage of being able to mix it with juice, thus reducing the smell of the vodka, explains the chief physician.
A spokeswoman for Motol Eva Jurinová Faculty Hospital agrees.
& quot; The most common word is Fernet or Rum. & quot;
& quot; This is the current alcohol trend, especially in elementary schools. & quot;
& quot; Sometimes it was also about Slibowitz, which one takes from home & quot;, led Mrs. Jurinová.
According to Pelikan, thirteen or fourteen year old drinkers in hospital are by no means an exception.
Before the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of Motol hospital, where ambulances delivered intoxicated students from near and far.
& quot; A girl had to be hospitalized four times.
& quot; She began her career at the age of 12 when she was admitted for the first time with 3.5 blood alcohol in her blood and in combination with & quot; Extase & quot;, described by her doctor one particularly severe case.
& quot; She was at some dance party in the exhibition grounds in Holesovice. & quot;
& quot; The interesting thing about this was that it didn 't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn' t come home for 48 hours, wondered the head physician.
It is precisely the lack of interest on the part of the parents, or their incredible tolerance when toasting their own offspring, that is considered to be one of the main reasons for children's growing alcoholism.
Real addiction, in the true sense of the word, is not what children are about, according to experts.
& quot; Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependency on alcohol and all its effects, and it is not the case in these children.
In most cases, those who drink repeatedly have a negative familial-social background, explains Pelican.
According to Motol Hospital spokeswoman Mrs Jurinová, by the middle of November around forty drunken children were admitted to the local Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning requiring hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children brought home after out-patient treatment by parents or possibly by police are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children only drink a bottle of liquor in the school bench, there are three seasonal amplitudes that children can rely on one hundred percent of the time, according to Pelikán: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
& quot; The last mentioned for two reasons - either out of sorrow for bad testimony or out of joy on vacation. & quot;
& quot; On Walpurgis Night, I experienced seven drunken children at once in the intake, emphasizes Dr. Pelikan.
A drunken child who spends the night under the supervision of a doctor is paradoxically better off than a child who suffers only from an unpleasant hangover the following day.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be cured in the hospital with a liquid infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
& quot; They are clearly better off because after the & quot; wonderful & quot; experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood, without anything hurting. & quot;
& quot; They are just a bit confused about where they are & quot; admits Doctor Pelikan, sometimes spoiling patients' good humor at least by telling them the cost of the treatment they will have to pay.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on some tens of thousands of crowns.
& quot; Sometimes I used this as an educational tool, when I calculated directly to the children during the visit what their drunkenness cost and it is quite possible that they have to work all the time during the vacation to earn the money for a single such party & quot;, added Dr. Pelikan.
However, he believes that insurance companies do not resort to recourse to recover the costs from parents of the drunken children.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light combat aircraft, out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defense has replaced with the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
This is the first time that this type of machine has been owned by a foreign army.
In foreign countries, they have only been seen during maneuvers or air shows.
This is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single seated L-159 aircraft.
These are still in conservation at the moment, but the broker of this deal - the Omnipol company - took them over last week.
When it will physically deploy the aircraft from Vodochody is not yet known, according to Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense.
The single-seat L-159 fighter jet, on the other hand, has been discarded from long-term aircraft, with no further contribution or investment from the ministry's portfolio.
& quot; The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current state and appearance, 'Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
The Army will not have to operate without two-seater fighter jets, he added, since the Defense Department signed a $200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159 aircraft into a two-seater.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the second one wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to integrate the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
& quot; The contract clearly states that EADS is a purchaser of the L-159 aircraft and that it will use it to train pilots from NATO countries.
& quot; So it is up to the buyer how he realizes the thing, 'Pejšek explained.
The business daily (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The bartering of five L-159 for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for tenders at the time, but spoke directly to EADS about the purchase.
The Department of Defense argued that the swap would facilitate the future export of the L-159 to other countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 aircraft, only 24 of them were used, the rest it wanted to sell.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is also likely to have a legal repercussions.
The European Commission took the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice. The reason: it would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of an entire European tender, and not by targeting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes, the last of which is due to land at Kbely Airport within a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That's the surprising finding of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is thought to be related to levels of the male hormone testosterone.
& quot; Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to 60's age, said the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should definitely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health stresses, added Ms. Eeles.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer in the UK, as well as 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men were equally likely to develop prostate cancer, as were 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, this risk was reduced by 33 percent for men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, and even by 87 percent for men in their 60s.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which form already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone equals a longer index finger.
Previous research has suggested that testosterone precisely accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, said he was not familiar with the study, but he did not think the relationship between finger length and cancer risk was fully established.
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 blocked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic was covered by a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
There is mostly frozen snow on the roads and sidewalks, while winter workers were out on the road all night.
The D5 motorway, between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov, is closed due to accidents involving heavy goods vehicles, while the D1 motorway near Brno is closed in the direction of Prague & quot;.
This was said by Novinky. cz the dispatcher of ÚAMK.
A lorry crashed at kilometre 91, two lorries collided at kilometre 93, and there are casualties in this accident.
There are also a few cars lying in the ditch.
Problems are also encountered at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Again, two trucks collided.
Drivers should depart immediately after Brno at km 190 or cycle through Brno and turn into Kývalka at km 182.
There, traffic jams lasting kilometres are formed.
There was also an accident on the D11, on the approach to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus 7 degrees Celsius.
Motorcades are forming, for example, in the Prosek quarter, and Štěrboholská Street is also completely blocked.
The safest method of transportation is definitely the Metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o 'n the morning, the Prague Crisis Task Force meets.
There are also problems with the railways and the airfield.
Czech Railways had to cancel seven fast train services due to snow drifts.
Problems can occur, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or also Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers should check the situation very closely.
Airport Ruzyně is closed since Wednesday 11: 00 AM until 5: 00 AM.
Most roads in Southern Moravia are passable only with a high degree of caution.
Three secondary roads are completely impassable around Vyškov. Snow drifts can be seen in some parts of Brno, and snow guns can be used on some higher streets in the vicinity of Blansko.
One of the worst affected areas is Výškov.
Three roads are still closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
Again, you will have to use a snow blower to clear the snow.
It is not yet possible to predict when they will become accessible again.
The Hodonín region should tread carefully in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for conservation reasons are only allowed to be strewn with inert litter, there is a blanket of snow up to five centimeters thick, ČTK explained.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most of it in Northern Bohemia - in some places up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian Region up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In Czech Republic, however, it is slowly stopping snowing.
American soldiers have a new & quot; smart weapon & quot;
For the first time, American troops have deployed a new & quot; intelligent & quot; weapon in Afghanistan, which up to now is only known as XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precision cannon.
Your projectiles are guided by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special bullets of 25 mm caliber, designed for this rifle and containing high explosives, work like small grenades.
The missiles can be programmed to explode at any point in the ballistic trajectory, not only on impact with the target.
This means that it can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, in a wall or in a trench.
It is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter from above can easily knock it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new assault rifle is the first infantry weapon to utilize & quot; intelligent & quot; technologies.
& quot; The soldier basically proceeds like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam, which determines the distance, then he gains an exact sight point, after which he corrects the angle of increase, then he only has to press the trigger.
& quot; Let's say you measured 543 m. & quot;
& quot; When you pull the trigger, the gun charges itself and fires the bullet at a distance of 543 yards, plus minus one, two or three yards.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu Group relocates its subsidiary in Bad Homburg / Germany to Frankfurt.
In July next year 400 employees will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
The industry giant, which specialises in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday that in July next year, 400 men and women will move their workplace from the former office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs should be accommodated there, which so far have been spread out over the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open plan offices in Astro Park were better suited to the working methods of employees.
In Bad Homburg too, Fujitsu was only a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, & quot; with Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with an excellent infrastructure.
The excellent accessibility to the airport is extremely important, especially for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company in the region yesterday brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers.
The Frankfurt head of the economic department Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was another win for a & quot; global player.
This is a & quot; great location statement.
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (Green Party) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was notified of the intention early on by the management.
& quot; We have of course offered our help to the company & quot; said Korwisi.
The friendly contacts could not change anything about the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
The aim now, he said, is to prevent a long vacancy in such a prominent location.
& quot; I hope the owner and landlord of the building proves cooperative. & quot;
The previously used Fujitsu house on Rathausplatz and the neighbouring & quot; Kleine Vertikale & quot;, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz, were among the most controversial developments in the spa town ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private developer, a new city centre was built between the train station and the town hall, which attracted criticism for its massive development of the area, which had previously been partly used as a car park, as well as for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri, the investment advisory and rating firm, moved into the premises, as did Start Amadeus, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, as well as Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer then still affiliated with Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold one year later to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konuzern describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides computers and servers to businesses, for example, and provides the necessary services.
The Rhine-Main branch is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions will move into Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg, while the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
The headquarters of the Central Association of the Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry are among others located in the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan.
Amazon Blocks Servers - Threats Against Assange
WikiLeaks is coming under increasing pressure.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the Revealing Platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure behind this, following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and corporations to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is said to be in Britain, according to a newspaper report.
& quot; Wikileaks Ousted From Amazon Server.
& quot; Free Speech in the Land of Free & quot;, the Revealing Activists informed via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic cables in order to cope with the high numbers of visitors to the documents.
Via Twitter, Wikileaks explained further about the step: & quot; Great - our dollars are now being spent to keep people busy in Europe. & quot;
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, & quot; should stop selling books & quot;.
Amazon has suspended WikiLeaks' use of its servers after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman investigated, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, reported the British & quot; Guardian.
& quot; I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner, given WikiLeaks' prior publication of classified information,'said the senator.
Lieberman meanwhile called for blocking the platform from being used in other countries as well.
& quot; Wikileaks & apos; illegal, egregious and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe & quot;, 'the nonpartisan senator said in a statement.
& quot; No responsible company, American or foreign, should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper & quot; The Independent & quot;, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, the exact location being known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigations in Sweden as a conspiracy of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there had been threats.
& quot; There were even calls for Julian Assange to be murdered. & quot;
This is why Assange is right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously reacting to statements from North America.
In America, Mike Huckabee, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - obviously ironically - on television that Assange should be killed & quot; and Obama could use a drone.
A brawl broke out between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it' ridiculous and absurd 'that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently exposed espionage charges against diplomats.
& quot; I am not quite sure why we care about a guy's opinion with a web page & quot;, says Gibbs.
& quot; Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one web page. & quot;
The US government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Action, Russell Travers, has been named as the special envoy, the White House said.
Travers was responsible for developing the necessary structural reforms, which became necessary after the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which all government exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would provide security for dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the WikiLeaks release.
& quot; We have done everything we could to get in touch with them, "said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
& quot; We stand ready to protect them if necessary. & quot;
The Ice University
At & quot; Gelato University & quot; near Bologna, ice cream makers are preparing for better seasons.
The three-day Basic Course for Future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
Of the gelatiere and of the gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German "Gelatiere" (A little old-fashioned ice cream maker), produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The gelataio picks up the ice cream from the cooling counter with a spatula, puts it in the wafer, and then sells it.
To know this, you do not need to go to Anzola dell 'l' Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can 't miss the & quot; Gelato University & quot; by the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice Cream University was founded by the maker of ice cream machines in 2003 to make sure that the ice cream made from his machines matched the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day Basic Course for Future Gelatieri has the largest number of visitors and visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses lasting several days around chocolate ice cream and internships in the hotel's own ice cream parlour.
Some people dream of a new career in a midlife crisis, others simply venture onto the icy ice of their vague longings.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice-cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag her own after years in a nerve-wracking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her kids love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Not only good taste but also silky smoothness and good consistency are crucial.
Luciano does not forget the icing on the national and generally southern superstructure in his training: & quot; Italian gelato is simply the best - and there is a lot of romance in it. & quot;
The first step to creation seems simple.
Luciano tips the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cool down to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap on the machine and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, which is the basis for all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to your experimentation?
Luciano warns against letting himself be misled by the zeitgeist.
If you are talking about & quot; ice cream made only of natural ingredients, you may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar bean gum.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabilizer, but you have to sell it within a day or it will collapse and the customer will bite.
Certain variations of the ground mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
& quot; The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of flavored additives for you. & quot;
& quot; But you should try. & quot;
Either the fruit sorbet with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or for ice cream made from the white base mass, which turns into yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder, forming the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream, with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
Fruit ice varieties are subjected to the same experiment.
More flavors, more fruit puree - it is not necessarily better in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water, and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced blend can really enhance the flavor of a gelato, Luciano says.
Making ice cream is a math: if you use peach puree with lots of sugar, you have to reduce the amount of sugar in the base recipe.
Lemon Ice requires an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano pulls out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (winemakers use it to measure the oechsle in the grape juice).
Fortunately, spreadsheets make calculating easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic preparation of the base mass helps.
There is also a machine where the finished ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped and cooled to freezing temperatures.
Despite all the automation, there are still some minor glitches.
Brazilian Gustavo splashes fruit puree on himself and his fellow students from top to bottom, as the oversized stick mixer gets out of control.
& quot; In each course & quot;, says Maestro Luciano, & quot; it is only a matter of time before something like this happens. & quot;
Checkers in Twilight
The European Food Authority, Efsa, is infiltrated by the gene plant experimentation industry.
This accusation is now being reproached by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which sees itself as an independent institute for the assessment of biotechnology effects.
& quot; It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well & quot;, said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been contracted for years by the lobbying association Ilsi.
This is paid by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in the Efsa testing regulations for genetically modified plants and was therefore in a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa regulations are paragraph by paragraph the same as Ilsi position papers and bear the hallmark of the industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech complains about a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa executive recently joined Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any conditions or transition period - and switched sides.
The Central German Broadcasting Corporation (MDR) has also recently revealed personal links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as MEPs very keen.
Efsa cannot detect a conflict of interest.
There is a recourse to all serious data, including those from the industry, as long as it is of high technical quality, says a statement.
Do not expect the experts working for Efsa not to have contacts to the industry.
You would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits to working for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobby mandate.
On the substance, independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding attempt on animals, and that the reaction of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not tested.
& quot; We want to know, for example, what genetically modified corn does in the field, says Then;.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
& quot; If you do n 't look for risks, how do you find them? & quot; asks Then accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way too.
The scientist researches since 1994 in the genetic engineering and is currently working at the technical university Zurich.
In this field, as in the USA, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe.
As a result, there are hardly any researchers left who are not intertwined with corporations.
Studies critical to companies would usually not be published.
& quot; The industry controls security research, claims Hilbeck.
The trace of the tiles
Uli Gsell also got some, about 400 kilos in total.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgart train station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and had begun to demolish a large part of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multi-billion dollar lowering of the station.
When construction was stopped, most of the wing was in pieces.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is 43 years old, a sculptor in Ostfildern.
He's secured a few of the chunks.
& quot; These stones are relics. & quot;
& quot; They must not disappear. & quot;
He raves: & quot; A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy. & quot;
When he saw one, he smelled cigarette smoke.
What he will do with the pieces, he does not know yet.
Checkers have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44 year old trades old stones.
He bought all the items that were lost during the demolition in Stuttgart.
& quot; It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or dumped in a landfill & quot;, "he says in his office, a wooden bunch that was once a guardhouse.
He was verbally abused and threatened, he was told, when it was reported in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remnants of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he has talked to S-21 opponents, for days.
And he told them that he could do nothing about the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most sensible thing to do is to keep using the stones.
Around 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the cuboids, which weighed an average of 80 kilos, with a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to give it back when it is rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half of these are still storing in the forest, the rest have long since been sold.
Landowner, landscaper, home builder.
They had come from everywhere and dragged away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart Stones of Knuß have long since been transformed into & quot; Mäuerle & quot; or into herb beds.
& quot; Actually, this stone is nothing special & quot;, says Rongen.
& quot; If it was not the political component. & quot;
He climbs into his SUV and takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and then dropped out of university, then became interested in computers and finally became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
40000 tons of bricks he stores.
From all over Germany he compiles his treasures.
He says that he is the largest Old Stone merchant in the Republic.
He slows down.
There are artistically hewn sandstones in the snow.
& quot; They once belonged to the Marienbrücke in Dresden, 'he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
& quot; My Favorite Stone. & quot;
Walk up the path through the forest.
Pointing to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe train station.
And on.
& quot; Beautiful Travertine. & quot;
The cuboids were once part of the grandstand at Stuttgart's Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the Snow rocks and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral Sankt Blasien, tuff from Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were formerly hand-hewn and moved with simple pulleys and oxcarts, he becomes very awe-inspiring.
& quot; It would be scandalous if we shred something like that. & quot;
He did not become rich, not to say that he did not become rich.
But the stone merchant employs 14 people today, plus there are up in the forest stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener.
& quot; We work hard, but it's satisfying & quot; says the remainder recycler.
He must go to Cologne soon.
There, too, there are bricks to save.
Talent Battle for High Potentials
There is a lot of people at the buffet.
16 students throng around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technische Universität Braunschweig and Volkswagen, the car manufacturer, invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they will talk to VW developers about the cars of the future - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies now go to war and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates in the classrooms as early as possible, before they get into the labor market and are wooed by others.
And because universities do not publish lists of student performance, attempts are made to detect and retain exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car company will be wooing the talents.
A young lady from the Human Resources department hands out ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with the VW logo.
She tells the promising young talents about internships and student jobs and shows them their way into the company.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig University of Technology is responsible for VW's project.
He sees the benefits for both sides: & quot; students get in touch with the industry and gain experience. & quot;
& quot; VW can simultaneously meet students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who might be considered for staff. & quot;
Such collaborations are not uncommon, says Selle.
What is new is that there is so much offensive booing around the students.
& quot; Otherwise the focus was more on the technical project & quot;, says Selle.
The battle for newly graduated students will probably get even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
Rather, they have to show themselves and courtship especially with highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering vacancies remained vacant in October.
And the so-called engineer gap will become even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta is on the hunt for talent for the accounting and consulting firm KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events, such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern-day treasure hunt, in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the US next year.
By the way, participants can visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Whoever is allowed to participate will decide in two rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many candidates flies to the USA.
When you're hitting and stabbing around the high potentials at universities, the cannons get bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
& quot; We want to stand out from the crowd with our race. & quot;
& quot; Just a simple sailing trip was too little for us. & quot;
For Dykta, the calculation seems to be working.
& quot; We have been in touch with all participants of a similar action last year. & quot;
& quot; Some are about to graduate and want to apply for our job soon, "he says.
In addition to direct booing on campus, small and medium-sized businesses are also going berserk at trade fairs.
& quot; We try to reach graduates at trade fairs.
& quot; Exhibition at Intersolar & quot;, reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young generation problem.
There are currently 35 vacancies available on the company's website.
& quot; It's very hard to fill vacancies right now. & quot;
& quot; This costs a lot of time and money,'she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
& quot; The professors give tips that you can do internships or write your diploma. & quot;
Expensive promotions are out of the window for the solar specialist.
The company tries to promote itself with other advantages: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
& quot; A large corporation often cannot offer this. & quot; says HR Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld was ranked 55th among Germany's top 100 employers in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute compiles an annual ranking of German employers.
To do this, it surveys employees about how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment, and looks at the general conditions for employees.
Human resources manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also win her many positive points among the job seekers.
& quot; I think applicants are especially looking for external reviews of a potential employer,'she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means mostly internal actions, according to Kriegler.
& quot; The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer, he says, is through his own employees.
In industry jargon, this means internal employer branding within the company's own workforce.
& quot; Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors. & quot;
If you treat your people well and they identify themselves with the company, they would spontaneously promote their employer to friends and acquaintances.
& quot; This is like playing with gang & quot;, Kriegler says.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida, in the Gulf of Mexico, in the coming years.
The government in Washington has issued a corresponding ban - and thus permanently revoked its earlier plans.
Also off the Atlantic coast, new drilling is prohibited for the moment.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar announced the announcement Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to be in force for at least the next five years, was the explosion of the rig & quot; Deepwater Horizon & quot; in April.
Before the disaster, which killed 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, signaled his willingness to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the USA on oil supplies from abroad.
Who is responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been definitively clarified.
The British energy company BP, which is facing billions in claims, is at the centre of the criticism.
An investigative commission commissioned by Obama is scheduled to report its findings later this month.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
In the process of fundamental reform, the competent supervisory authority, which has been brought into disrepute following numerous allegations of corruption, is undergoing a major overhaul.
In parallel, Obama has announced plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now warning publicly that, if regulation were tightened, production in the Gulf would be much lower than it currently is.
& quot; The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry & quot;, is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy BDO - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: & quot; No one knows what exactly will change with the regulation. & quot;
Investment in new subsidies would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned out
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at a petrol station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland, Nigeria.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil boiling.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
& quot; Don 't hesitate & quot;, the eco-activist calms the journalists: & quot; You' ll get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today. & quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a boy wading into the water up to his chest with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored gloss of the water, the scene seems almost pretty.
There is no sign of brown crude oil billowing underneath the surface.
In the past, she had gathered shrimp in buckets here, Esther Badom says, on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
In the meantime, the sluggish flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil leaked from a ruptured pipeline into the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-rich waters. Ogoniland, in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
Driving through mangrove swamps crisscrossed by streams, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the boat bursts into brown broth, drawing oily fingers out of anyone who dips their hand in the water.
The roots of the mangrove trees stick out of the ground like black liquorice sticks, sad sporadically encountering palms let their fronds hang.
Swarms of birds, which are usually customary in wetlands, are sought in vain. As soon as the outboard is silent, ghostly silence spreads in what is supposed to be a petrol station-like former paradise.
& quot; What is happening here is ecological warfare & quot; says somber Celestine Akpobari: & quot; We are in constant danger of health. & quot;
The war comparison is enabled.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a disputed battleground for decades: it was here that the first explorers from Europe arrived more than 60 years ago; it was here where the first resistance started in the 1980s, with the later executed author Ken Saro-Wiwa; it was here where the Shell Group had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is still barred from returning to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland are too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred meters, steel racks rise out of the water like bizarre sculptures: & Quot; Christmas Trees & Quot;, the heads of the boreholes are called far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the marrow.
Time and again, Akpobari thinks, such a drill head breaks apart, then a steady stream of crude oil trickles into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year the amount of oil that leaked into the sea off Alaska during the accident of the super tanker & quot; Exxon Valdez & quot; 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who is to be held responsible for the continuing ecological meltdown is disputed.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see burst wellheads and leaked pipelines as the main culprits.
Shell's safety standards in Nigeria are substantially lower than those normally found in the rest of the world, US scientist Richard Steiner reproached the group in 2008: "The rate of defects in the pipes alone is many times higher than elsewhere."
In a place that, from a distance, looks like an abandoned oil-spattered workshop in the open air, mangroves emerge with shapes: they are naked and oil-spattered to the neck.
A fire is flickering under one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to the pipes and some of which are randomly spread over the area. This is an illegal small-scale refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First gasoline penetrates the collector through the pipes, later kerosene and finally diesel trickles out of the pipe.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel a day 300 liters: & quot; That brings us 34.000 naira a & quot; - approximately 22 Dollar.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal stoves can still undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel at just under 40 euro cents per litre: they get their raw material for nothing.
It comes from & quot; bunkers tapping the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, at least 16 million liters of crude oil are lost every day in the whole of the Niger Delta.
Only a tiny fraction of the temporary raw material is illegally refined: the lion's share is transferred to tankers and smuggled out onto the global market by organised criminal networks, which are said to include politicians and high-ranking military officials.
The debate about whether the environmental disaster is caused more by the hustle and bustle of the population or by the lax way of production is purely academic, according to Akpobari.
& quot; If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries.
In the meantime, however, the relationship of the Ogoni, especially with Shell, has been so damaged that only a withdrawal of the corporation would be considered: & quot; Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better.
Michael gets nervous.
& quot; High time you disappeared & quot; says the muscular oilman.
& quot; Soldiers can come any minute. & quot;
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special forces of the Armed Forces, they will not be threatened with arrest, but with a painful bribe.
Like all Nigerians, the soldiers, mainly from the north of the country, want to profit from the raw material.
& quot; This damn stuff brought our country to the point in every way & quot;, Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous build error in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major safety problem.
Investigators investigating an emergency landing have discovered a possible construction error that could lead to a catastrophic & quot; engine failure.
Airline Qantas is now suing the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the emergency landing of the Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seemed to have had much more luck than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 aircraft - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: an oil hose connection could generate fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB said in a statement released by the authority on Thursday.
This could have led to a catastrophic failure of the & quot; engine.
The affected engines are those manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
This includes the Qantas Airbus which made an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of claim in the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing further legal action to be taken against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would seek damages for the incident in early November.
In the event of a fire, parts had come loose and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that they will perform additional safety tests on the superjumbos equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue has been deemed sufficiently important to address all affected users.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas plane, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its eleven A380s.
As a precaution, Lufthansa changed the engine of an A380.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Countrywide Snow Triggers Traffic Chaos
Germany all in white: Snow fell almost all over the country overnight.
Many roads are in chaos, with cancellations for trains and flights.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter freezes in Germany: freezing temperatures saw snow cover almost the entire Republic on Thursday night, causing traffic chaos in many places.
In the North and East there are some 15 cm thick snow sheets.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg the winter service was in continuous operation, but could not cope with the constantly blowing snow.
There were also heavy gusts along the Baltic coast.
The Federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges along the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning onwards, with water levels of 1.2 meters above normal.
In Saxony, drifting snow caused major problems on highways and highways.
According to Meteomedia, the severe weather center, an alert was issued for Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Partly 30 cm of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds blew.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt too, police forces reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind caused traffic jams and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are major disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the tracks or destroyed catenaries and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony the long distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop.
The 165 passengers were given blankets, food and drink on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
In major airports in Germany, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, some cancellations have already been reported, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information centre.
In Frankfurt, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is in continuous operation.
Only a few stranded passengers were at the airport, but nearly 400 camp beds were still available for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads as early as Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed when he collided with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was detected on a level crossing, because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she hit a car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
There is one piece of good news for meteorologists: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will already be churning up during light gusts.
But the wind will ease.
Only the Baltic Sea is affected by fast and stormy winds.
It remains very cold - down to minus 15 degrees Celsius in places.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyer for its Twin Towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part ways with its landmark building: According to a newspaper report, Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just spruced up its corporate headquarters: the twin towers in the banking district of Frankfurt have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial concern seems to want to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the & quot; Financial Times Deutschland & quot; writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
& quot; We always check if it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then rent it back, 'he said.
In this way, Germany's largest credit institution relinquishes its registered office after only a short period of time.
The bank took over the Twin Towers only in the middle of 2007 for 272 million euro from the investors of an in-house fund and afterwards lavishly reorganized.
The energy conversion gobbled up approximately 200 million euros, according to the data.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed & quot; Greentowers & quot;, at around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, is currently unclear, the spokesman said.
Thousands Mourn Dead Buddy
More than 10,000 people have paid tribute in New Zealand to the trapped miners who were pronounced dead after several explosions in a mine.
It has still not been possible to recover the bodies because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the crash shaft, but had found no trace of survivors.
Rescuers were unable to descend for safety reasons due to high concentrations of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no more chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now family members and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up, displaying helmets, lamps, and the names of their comrades.
There were also pictures and personal items, including clothing and surfboards.
Flags flew at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would & quot; come back from the depths of the earth & quot;, said New Zealand Prime Minister John Key to the participants of the commemoration.
& quot; But they never came home. & quot;
He could not come to terms with the death of his son unless he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the ceremony.
Miners of British and South African heritage were also buried in the initial explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases are displaced, cooling will begin on the scorching temperatures inside the mine, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell, warriors!
Will Splatter match Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic & quot; Valhalla Rising & quot;.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot & quot; Valhalla Rising & quot;?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and kills his enemies in series with almost superhuman power - ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, especially because our hero likes to use brutal killing methods and tears the intestines of his enemies when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters at most let themselves be carried away by a sentence or two, or a few agonizing cries of death.
Otherwise people will be silent and enjoy the spookily beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
It is nice if a movie has several target groups, but it is only a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn, since his wild and stylised drug-dealer trilogy & quot; Pusher & quot;, has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his work accessible to the art house with a little more humor or a little less brutality.
Most art-lovers will be put off by the amount of brain splashing around and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when EinAugen sets off for free interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries by ship to Jerusalem and is stuck an eternity in doldrums and fog, before the team appears to arrive in America and remain silent.
No wonder that & quot; Walhalla Rising & quot; could not find a cinema distributor in Germany and has only been released on DVD.
This is a shame, especially because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping façade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it is all atmosphere, a fever dream turned into film.
And there is no escaping the spectator.
Refn hardly allows him a moment of relaxation and slowly closes his throat to him with his icy images and the sinister trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the intangible hate that beats against him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blond boy, loyal to One Eye, retains something of an innocence; everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes the warrior of hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means spoiling, but perhaps only for the already spoiled.
& quot; Valhalla Rising & quot; is an enigmatic film that you can hate and admire, to annoyance, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Enigmatic Earthworks
The IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to comment - as yet, it does not allow checks.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cube-like building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the closest major city, Dair-as-Saur, is 30 kilometres away.
Their names appear in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria claims to have built, with help from North Korea, in the block, hidden in a valley that runs off electricity.
According to a briefing by the CIA, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built - in late April 2008.
The technology from the fifties is hardly suitable for other purposes.
The CIA presented a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
Using computer animation, she revealed where the components of the reactor were before the destruction, which is a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she submitted photos that show the building up close, or even the interior space.
The reactor was close to being commissioned, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known more than back then, the mysteries grew rather bigger over time.
Former US President George W. Bush revealed in his recent memoir that the CIA was fairly sure, prior to the attack, that Syria was building a reactor at el-Kibar, but saw scant evidence that there was an active nuclear weapons program in the country.
Some intelligence operatives in Europe prefer to be even more cautious, speaking only of a & quot; alleged reactor, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be plausible & quot;.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied succinctly in the summer that the IAEA had 'quot; enough material to ask questions & quot;'.
The Syrians hastily pulled aside the debris of the alleged & quot; unused military building and thoroughly leveled the ground.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found human-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, through a member state, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers in the immediate aftermath of the attack, which are likely to be more informative than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected that as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
It also prevents inspectors from conducting a second inspection in el-Kibar, and from gaining access to the rubble of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also steadfast in its silence.
& quot; We 'll never comment on this & quot; reiterated the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack.
As a result, the investigation into the case has been dragging on unsuccessfully since June 2008, and & quot; is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency, as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA is overseeing.
The IAEA apparently sees three additional facilities that are supposed to be functionally connected to the suspected reactor - and which do not still exist - as keys to progress in detection.
The inspectors have not yet revealed which installations are involved, which functions they have, or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information provided by the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj-as-Sultan, Masyaf, and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and, using satellite imagery, identified a complex of buildings near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - precisely because of this reason, Syria does not allow IAEA access to the three sites.
Vienna says the Syrians are afraid of a future expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
The nuclear detectives had become alerted to the facilities following a tip-off from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was being transported between the three sites and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be related to & quot; fuel production.
There is, however, no evidence of sensitive activities known as' quot; ', i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is run on non-enriched uranium.
But where the uranium should have come from, and where the plutonium for the bomb should have been removed from it later, there are only plausible guesses about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could have hidden valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the debris has gone.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria tested in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste deposit, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite imagery for the renowned magazine Jane & apos;'s Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria was conducting earthworks at the three suspect sites, removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be coincidence, but it has done little to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, diplomats say that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, designed to allow Syria to keep possible military secrets - the effort alone shows how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus also brushed off this suggestion.
While a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna had reassured me that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency. For example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been raising the issue of so-called special inspections, one of the most stringent methods that the Vienna Nuclear Power Authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already talked about & quot; an option I am open to in the future, but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this direction: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA's Board of Governors, and some of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for an escalation.
Secondly, as a diplomat points out: & quot; What if they can't find anything at the end? & quot;
Love in Times of War
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her as yet unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
There is not much more we know about - but that is enough for agitation.
There is a persistent rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, whereupon some of the filming days planned in Sarajevo were relocated to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic, from the Organisation of Female Victims of War, wrote to Jolie via the UN refugee agency UNHCR requesting a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador for the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic stressed.
Love stories in rape camps have never happened, and Jolie's attitude to the victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, according to the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write about scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself declares that she has no political intention with her film, that she has worked very hard to become familiar with the Yugoslavia conflict, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved.
It remains vague about the content, however.
A second synopsis of the film is circulating online, but it sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other in it even before the outbreak of the war, and they meet again when a Bosnian Muslim woman is kidnapped to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different from the variant & quot; rape victim has a crush on Tortorknecht & quot;.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that' s for sure.
Pressure on them, Jolie argues, is unfair and based on misinformation.
Now, only the hackers of Hollywood can make peace for her: by illegally putting the screenplay online, as so many before do.
Nothing but away here
This evening, things are finally going well again for the Irish.
Not a trace of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheer with joy, crashing loud music, stamping their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, south London, trembles because players throw ping-pong balls over a three-metre distance into beer cups - and hit them.
& quot; Bierpong & quot; is called the bizarre spectacle, the winner gets a 500 Euro win bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this flashy drinking game and the low-key computer scientist don 't really work together.
Yet the 26-year-old is trying to enjoy himself, distracted by the nagging question of what the future holds.
His plan is not to gamble in Las Vegas, he will do interviews in New Zealand in January.
& quot; I have a queasy feeling about it & quot;, 'he says.
& quot; It's so far away from home and yet I have no work there. & quot;
Anyway, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - & quot; she had jerk, twitch her dream job as an event manager, maybe a good sign & quot;, says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their happiness abroad.
His sister, Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, while his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys are leaving: On the island, many families look like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish are expected to leave the country in the near future, experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect as many as 200,000 emigrants.
For this small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants, it is a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are correct, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, dreariness is once again appearing.
The economic crisis is especially unsettling for the young, well-educated Irish, for whom hitherto there was only uphill work.
Job losses and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was plentiful.
Meanwhile, three out of ten men and women under thirty are unemployed.
The Irish Times is awash with letters from the editor of young emigrants complaining: & quot; Everything goes down in Ireland. & quot;
& quot; There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but if there are people who can, they leave and our country loses a whole generation. & quot;
& quot; The last person to turn the light off. & quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, believes the future is bleak because the government is' tinkering around the edges' and failing to give young people any hope for the future.
& quot; They are reducing the minimum wage, but they do not have a strategy how to create new jobs & quot; says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students wriggle from one unpaid internship to another.
Her biggest worry, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years "time.
& quot; This idea is sad and depressing. & quot;
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to put a positive spin on the topic.
McLarnon organizes & quot; WorkingAbroadExpo & quot;, a trade show that provides an all-around service on working abroad.
& quot; Working abroad is a great opportunity for young professionals to take their first steps on the ladder, says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not only about galleys, it is also about freedom and fun.
Seán O 'apos; Donovan has known for half a year how it feels to build something else.
Because there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
They are currently pulling up a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January we will continue to Hanover or Berlin for the next project.
Meanwhile, O & apos; Donovan rarely sees his home, because he works extra shifts to pay off the loan for his house at home.
& quot; The situation is a bit crazy & quot;, says he, stepping over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
& quot; I am making money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am hardly ever again. & quot;
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a nice residential neighborhood with well-kept front gardens, large, expensive cars park in the driveways.
Together with a sister, O & apos; Donovan bought the house four years ago for 380.000 Euro - 100% loan-supported.
& quot; It was crazy times, easy money without many questions & quot;, he says.
Is he worried that things might go wrong with the loan?
O & apos; Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says: & quot; I have no kids to feed and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over. & quot;
The civil engineer does not like the wailing that he often hears nowadays.
& quot; No one has to go hungry - our situation is nowhere near as dramatic as it was here on & quot;, "he says.
Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish. & quot;
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England during the last big economic crisis.
& quot; After seven years, he was back and life went on in Ireland, simple. & quot;
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and see how life goes elsewhere.
He has already had a couple of years of work in London and why should it not go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
There is, however, one thing that really worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it might degenerate into a farewell party.
& quot; Just not too many emotions & quot;, he says, sipping a large sip of his beer.
Farewell to & quot; it sounds scary. & quot;
& quot; Let's call it a go-away party, casual, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games. & quot;
The Democracy Routine
The pro-democracy movement in Latin America is growing, as is support for private enterprise.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These are the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and exclusively published in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, showing the change of opinion in this region.
There are two facts that caught & apos;'s eye in this year' s survey, conducted in September and October.
Firstly, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In numerous countries along the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has grown sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown at an annual rate of about 6% since 2002, the number of pro-democracy supporters increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Mexico, where the economy has rebounded since the sharp slump last year, has also seen a trend.
But only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are staunch Democrats, bringing the regional average down (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practices, up from about 25% last year (Chart 3).
Some 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% their government. Both values correspond to those of last year but show a significant increase since 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to become more democratic.
That this continued during the global economic crisis is perhaps because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession and quickly recovered.
Moreover, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social safety net.
(According to this week's reports from the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, in 2009 the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly, and it fell again by 32% this year.)
But there are strong differences in mood from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva are reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more pronounced and violent crime has increased.
For only the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as being more of a problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Some 31% say that either they themselves or a family member became the victim of a crime in the last year, but down from 38% last year, the numbers are down to their lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in the increased support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents working nationally said that the private sector is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of those surveyed in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% supported private enterprise), despite the fact that its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private businesses.
Brazil is the most important country in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, on the other hand, consider the US to be the most influential country, with Venezuela taking the role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An Election Slap
Nobody expected that the elections on November 28th in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far outweighed the fears of the election workers who rushed to the aid of the stricken country.
Crowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot boxes in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just some of the problems.
Polling stations were delayed for hours.
Many Haitians, many of whom were made homeless by the earthquake in January, wandered around in search of a place to choose from.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected front-runners, demanded that the election results be annulled because of alleged fraud.
Protests, some of them violent, erupted across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN Mission in Haiti, described the election as fairly good in many respects.
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, supposedly beholden to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The expected runoff is scheduled for Jan.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claim.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is declared the winner of the runoff by the Berhörde, this could create problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake's victims are still living in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting because of poor organization.
Shortly before the beginning of the vote, approximately 250,000 identification cards needed to vote had not yet been issued.
The stakes are high.
Donor countries see a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Stealy Into the Center
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a surge of sympathy, driving her approval rating 20 points higher, to over 50%, the highest since she was elected in 2007.
Whether this helps her win re-election next year depends on whether visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The characters for this are not unique.
Néstor Kirchner, who steered economic policy even after his wife was elected, often drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income as they pleased.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27th led to further clashes.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists sided with Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (in which one lawmaker punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
& quot; I will not discuss & quot;, said the President.
The 2010 budget now applies to next year too, giving the President even more scope to spend money as she sees fit.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but many private estimates - and union demands - drive it to nearly 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and fighting poverty, not reducing inflation, to be his main objectives.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullied the private sector, and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census, INDEC, which then whittled down the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called for talks between the private sector and union leaders.
And officials say they will cap pay increases at 18% next year.
The high world price of Argentina's agricultural products has given a strong boost to the economy.
But inflation undermined the growth boost by a major devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Cristina Fernández wants to bring Argentina back into the world financially.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had rejected the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández appears to be pushing for a deal with the Paris club backers, to whom she owes about $6.7bn.
The Kirchners had always refused IMF verification, as was customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide technical assistance in creating a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step in cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known if Fernández will continue to be politically active after her term ends, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has had enough of Kirchnerism for the most part.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy shown to them will have died away.
If she wants to win another election, she needs to decide whether she wants to quietly overturn many of her husband's political decisions.
Low Applause to China
Taiwan's voters are slowly coming closer to closer ties with the mainland.
What does Taiwan make of its big brother across the Strait?
On November 27th, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the total, went to vote for mayors and city councillors in the city's five boroughs. This is considered to be a broad rating by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself has become a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policies have transformed mainland China for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, Ma would have faced problems.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP joined forces with the KMT on the local council.
During the election, customary events occurred in Taiwan, including truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass parades, and scantily-clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory mysterious murder attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election about a KMT candidate,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Separately, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, said the attack marred the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner in the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not discussed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to emphasize its relationship with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP avoided stirring up too much anti-Chinese sentiment.
It was responding to a new awareness that Taiwan's economy could not survive without China.
Ma, for his part, wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his policy on China.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wishes to see political integration, but the most important thing comes first.
It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was a strong supporter of absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of moderate politicians emerged, and the DPP struggles to win the votes of the working class and the young.
Tsai was widely approved as the DPP's presidential candidate, as Su Tseng-chang was under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it is also capable of building close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to set up an think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a trustworthy alternative to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the DPP's candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan' s independence.
He even asked pragmatist Su to refrain from running for president.
Even without Chen's involvement, the DPP finds it difficult to choose its prospective candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's ratings are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
An KMT spokesman said that he will rearrange his cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong stance taken by the DPP suggests that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to & quot;, &, by Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, there is already no turning back.
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly named Newcomer of the Year
When you show up at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Surprisingly, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer was nominated for this year's Grammy Awards in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album & quot; Esperanza & quot; in 2008, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it is consistent with the Grammy rules, which require that an artist has released no more than three albums before the album with which Spalding became known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, & quot; Chamber Music Society & quot;, is certainly a step forward. And with her exhilarating voice and good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding is comparable to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success as a jazz performer in 2003 in this category comes closest to nominating Spalding.
In addition, Vijay Iyer Trio's album & quot; Historicity & quot; was nominated in the Instrumental Album category, a critical favorite.
Iyer's competitors include & quot; Moody 4B & quot; by veteran saxophonist James Moody and & quot; Positootly & quot; by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough-and-tumble favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's & quot; Treme & quot;, was recognized in the Contemporary Jazz category, which tends to include albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Wild Steampunk musician Darcy James Argue's Secret Societ received well-deserved attention in the Large Group category. He will compete against the Billy Childs Ensemble, with its chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and its octet, whose Life-Ablum & quot; Pathways & quot; is a good example of a bassist as Democratic leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical categories
The Classical Nominations for the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards include a diverse mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list is topped by Michael Daugherty's & quot; Deux Ex Machina & quot; for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys & quot; Dreamhouse & quot;' s eclectic orchestral work with three voices.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt, with his Symphony No. 4 & quot; Los Angeles & quot;. This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered in 2009 at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical music nominations are divided into 13 categories, ranging from orchestral music, opera and choir recordings to solo recordings.
In the category of classical music producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominated classical albums include Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty' s & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot; and & quot; Metropolis Symphony & quot; performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys & quot; Dreamhouse & quot; performed by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; & quot; Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati & quot;
In the Opera category, Bergs & quot; Lulu by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses & quot; Marc Antonio e Cleopatra & quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos & quot; L & apos; Amour de Loin & quot; by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot; by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans & quot; Ivanhoe
Composers nominated include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot;, Hans Werner Henze for & quot; Appassionatamente Plus & quot;, Magnus Lindberg for & quot; Graffiti & quot; and Shchedrin for & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot;.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded on January 4th at Disney Hall by the L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece is titled & quot; Los Angeles & quot; and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's & quot; Mondoline Concerto & quot; received a nomination in the category Instrumental Solo with Orchestra.
The composer from L.A. claimed that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
& quot; I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms & quot;, Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Performance Category for Orchestral Performance for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Instrumental soloists nominated include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classical Crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording & quot; Roots - My Life, My Song & quot;.
Temecula mosque wins planning committee approval
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
But according to a statement released by the commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will be an aesthetic eye-catcher.
& quot; The project is being supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others & quot; said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center on Thursday morning.
& quot; Being an American makes me proud. & quot;
& quot; It shows that justice reigns. & quot;
& quot; There are very few opponents to & quot;, 'he added.
& quot; They are just very loud. & quot;
& quot; Wonderful people live in this valley. & quot;
The session started at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against building the center lasted almost until midnight, with votes from both sides being fairly evenly divided according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
& quot; There is no more America & quot;, one comment read.
& quot; It's another Planet of the Apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand. & quot;
& quot; America is at its end. & quot;
Planned Islamic Centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, for example near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York on September 11th, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted bigger and better places than the warehouse they rented with a water filter manufacturer.
The new 2300 m2 Mediterranean style mosque will have two minarets and will be approximately 13m tall.
It will be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 of land on Nicolas Road, close to Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered essential for life.
& quot; This organism has two possibilities.
& quot; It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow. & quot;
& quot; This makes it very special, even though it's almost like a & apos; alien & apos; way of life,' explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of Science on Thursday.
Six main elements have been considered essential - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
However, as the scientists discovered, the bacterium in California's Mono Lake continues to grow even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
& quot; One wonders what else is possible & quot; said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were disclosed, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery & quot; shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the & apos; standard & apos; elements, which we consider absolutely essential for life, are not necessarily pre-determined & quot;, said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Milton Keynes Open University in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
& quot; This work is unique because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another, Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since arsenic and phosphorus are chemically alike, she assumed that microbes exposed to both could possibly replace one element with the other.
& quot; The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus. & quot;
& quot; This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other. & quot;
& quot; But the difference is so great that arsenic has a different effect to phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears virtually everything, explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
While the microbes grow better in phosphorus, the fact that they can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is nothing new, but there has been no working example yet.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life used it.
& quot; This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from the early Earth Age & quot;, said Forster, who was not on Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Other stolen show dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four dogs stolen outside a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared Tuesday when unknown persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were sleeping outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were found Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
& quot; The good news is that the dogs are well & quot;, says Whitmore.
& quot; You are in good condition. & quot;
& quot; They have been returned to their rightful owners. & quot;
Whitmore did not give details about where the dogs were found or the circumstances leading up to their discovery.
& quot; Investigations underway. & quot;
& quot; We do not want to say any more, "Whitmore explains.
& quot; We are tracing some tracks. & quot;
The dog's owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unavailable for comment on Thursday.
They took their two dogs to a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs in separate locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were uninjured, according to authorities.
But the corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, were missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was scheduled to compete.
Peek told The Times on Wednesday that the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night Peek and Rickard checked themselves in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - to their motel room.
The thick-rocky Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window open one slit width apart, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6: 00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's reward' to anyone who could give a hint about the corgis. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
It was not clear Thursday whether a finder would be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM has finally been given the green light to start afresh.
A New York bankruptcy judge officially approved the & quot; creditor plan on Thursday to pay off $5 billion of debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's testimony, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law and there is nothing left to prevent the restart of MGM headed by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, co-founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will serve as chief executives of the slightly pared-down studio.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually become effective until JPMorgan Chase completes its planned $500 million loan to finance MGM's new production operations.
At the moment, a syndicate of the investment bank, which itself raises $75 million, is leading the company. Financing is expected to be completed by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to Moelis & amp; Co, the investment bank, to help management, which was struggling with interest payments of $300 million / year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & amp; Cooper's effort to solve MGM' s financial woes and pay off the studio's more than 140-plus creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders, and none wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started afresh when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal struggles.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & amp; Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 per month to manage the company, will receive a $4 million & quot; success bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio released only one movie and drew up an annual plan of seven or eight films scheduled for release in early 2012.
They are also planning two films based on & quot; The Hobbit; co-produced with Warner Bros.
The studio will need a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial stake in the two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who financed about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies resulted in no result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite gift is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gadgets can rip a sizable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX bicycles for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is about 10 classic skipping ropes or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys & quot; R & quot; Us and a BJ & apos; s Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law was in effect. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost slightly less than last year.
And while there are fewer new toys with their own website, the most popular of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a broader range.
More and more button-cell powered toys are hitting the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not stated otherwise, all prices are from Toys & quot; R & quot; Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children 3 years and older) are plush toys the size of guinea pigs that sing a note when you press their belly.
Pressing once equals a note, pressing repeatedly can play a song.
Multiple Sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you have started pressing, you cannot stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, children 2 and older) is the best choice.
Based on Elmo Live technology, which was developed last year, the animatronic doll features interactive features such as & apos; Simon says & apos;, and thanks to its innovative wheel-locked hinged legs, it can walk on the Moon.
Children testing the device use Mickey as their dance teacher. Their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for kids 3 and up), with a whole pile of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with an auto-correction feature as a teacher.
If you do not want to trust your child with your smartphone, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60 for children ages 3-8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The games included are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children ages 3-12), which has a new, brighter screen following Leapster' s first major reworking of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children ages 3-7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive also family photos can be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for kids 8 and up). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about folding the blocks together to form words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys are having some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone after the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal in the Club Penguin, you can purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2 & quot; Mix & apos; N Match Pack ($5 for children 6-12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the Code Online, your child will receive sufficient credits for two additional parts at the Club Penguin Store.
This can be a pair of skates or a puffle toy.
The latest Header Cell powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids 5 and up) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
Sending him through a maze of blocks is fun.
And he endures some.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Policing in China Will Be Softer
Like an officer in training, Tang Shenbin strode across a city square, checking his nervous subordinates and giving orders in a military-like voice and in a subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's rugged guardian of the urban order, feared and despised for their random raids and penchant for violence - to impress the audience.
Standing & quot; Straight!
& quot; Looking Straight Out!
& quot; Show them & quot;, he whispered to them, & quot; how pretty girls are! & quot;
Four girls, barely past their teenage years, wearing white gloves and identical olive jackets and trousers stood taut.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on top of the hair, which was held together with blue and white striped bows.
& quot; To me, they look average,'says Mr Tang dismissively.
& quot; models are pretty. & quot;
Several governments have tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
Guangdong Province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green uniform.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced violence with stare: In 2009, 50 officers reportedly circled an improperly positioned takeaway and stared at the operator until he packed up after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a city district of Chengdu with 680,000 residents, wants to fundamentally change its image.
Since 2003, 13 women have joined the municipal police force. They have been specially selected for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are supposed to give the rough police a softer, more feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would not succeed in correcting the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Quite rightly, say the critics.
Unlike police, these officers are allowed to enforce the city's laws only through fines or other administrative penalties.
Yet the Chinese media routinely paint a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat to death an onlooker who filmed them on his mobile phone beating down a protest against a rubbish dump.
Last year, a training manual written by Beijing officials was stolen and posted on the Internet, describing how criminals can be beaten up without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officers.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officers trained in China attacking street dealers.
& quot; Chengguan frightens the government & quot; lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversies about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a & quot; really thorough cleanup & quot;.
Sceptics consider the current approach significantly insufficient.
When the district reported in October that it was searching for eight female recruits, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real jobs, or were simply intended to be a visual distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18-22 with good physique and & quot; harmonious features were wanted.
They should be above average in size - over 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
Employment ends when the employee reaches the age of 26.
For women over 25, the physical activity is too strenuous, according to the officials.
& quot; The most important thing is its image, "an unnamed district official told the quasi-government website Rednet. com
& quot; Whether the candidate gets the job depends first of all on his or her appearance, such as height, weight, features, etc.
Then come temperament and & quot; inner qualities & quot;.
& quot; Females Chengguan 'are like flower vases & quot;,' he said, adding that they 'have other duties & quot;'.
Zheng Lihua, deputy chief of the district city administration, does not agree with this description,
admitted that size specifications in job advertisements are not uncommon in China for both sexes.
The same applies to uniform facial features.
Whether this equates to good looks is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
& quot; Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or humpbacks here,'said Mr Zheng.
& quot; Your Image Would Not Be Good. & quot;
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn 't feel that much of a burden on her appearance was sexist.
& quot; Do you think I look sexy in this uniform? & quot; asks with an ironic stare.
Your colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We've got the task to represent the image of the city."
They say they do not regret the short cessation because they have more ambitious career plans than simply pushing traders through the streets to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning, the patrol deals with about a dozen street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu as possible, on foot or by bicycle, before being chased away.
& quot; Mr. Wang, please disappear here. & quot;
& quot; We have told you so many times! & quot; explained to Miss Xu to a trader who had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his pasta kitchen, which was mounted on a bicycle cart.
According to the female civil servants, the work is monotonous rather than exhausting.
& quot; It's the same almost every day,' explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies Sales in her spare time.
& quot; Everything Routine. & quot;
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of the traders, as their male counterparts do.
They can only threaten offenders with reporting them to their male bosses.
This is to protect them from the public hostility to which officials in China are frequently subjected.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, went on a rampage after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the nightly incident, with 14 government vehicles overturned or set alight.
Xindu has not been affected by such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from quiet Baonguang Square, where the female officers were patrolling this morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that, contrary to regulations, was repaired on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the officers, grim-faced, made their way to their vehicles and continued on the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind, turning over his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
& quot; Sometimes we act verbally. & quot;
& quot; Sometimes, but also physically & quot;, explains Mr. Li soberly.
& quot; Most of the time people start arguing. & quot;
Prosecutor will not indict Senator Ensign
Prosecutors from the Department of Justice have cleared Senator John Ensign of charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision brings to an end the most serious legal challenge to Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal made national headlines and dampened his career, he was considered as a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Senator Ensign's office announced that it was pleased with the verdict after the one-year investigation.
The Senate Ethics Committee could yet impose a disciplinary penalty.
Ensign's lawyers say they have been notified by the Department of Justice that the investigation into Senator Ensign has been terminated and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was ample evidence Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first reported in The New York Times in October 2009, suggested that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of Hampton's campaign aides, win lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton' s wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Ensign's treasurer during the campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, after Hampton had been hired, he lobbied for her.
Since Hampton was not on Ensign's election team until recently, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the full Senate for a year.
Ethics experts say the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated what they call the revolving-door lobbying ban.
According to the published evidence & quot;, it appears to be collusion and violation of the revolving door statutes & quot;, "said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in the defense of clients targeted by the government.
While the Department of Justice officially declined to disclose the reasons for its decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed very cautious about accepting political charges following a series of defeats that received media attention, including its decision last year to drop charges against former Sen. Ted Stevens of Texas for misconduct.
Prosecutors' quot; obviously are terrible & quot;, said Melanie Sloan, the president of the & quot; Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington & quot; (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and governmental circles), a group of lawyers who brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
'This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them,' she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day telling him that the department would not bring charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator had acted in accordance with the law, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday.
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
& quot; I am not comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Department of Justice and myself. Just this: We believe we have made the right decision & quot;, "he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop its investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group alleging that a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there was insufficient evidence to show the money was anything more than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that has long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work, helped by Mr. Ensign.
An email dated December 2008 records that after the firm hired Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him that he was knocking on the door of the Interior Department regarding a matter called & quot;.
Mr. Ensign also arranged for lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after it hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When information about the affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and quit his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican hierarchy.
After not being seen for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said that the senator hoped that the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the Justice Department's lead and close its investigation.
& quot; Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work serving the people of Nevada,'she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped away in the courtroom fracas.
They posted their accounts of gruesome testimony on Twitter, every minute of the way.
In the end, the defense contended, there were more than 140,000 tweets about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, will officially come to an end when the judge rules on the death sentence handed down by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed motions in court, laying out reasons for an appeal that will occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporter - created a circus atmosphere, and the pervasiveness of inflammatory details was so widespread that the jury was unduly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could prompt the appeal courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
& quot; As I have experienced during this trial, I believe that there really is a danger when the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of every individual to a fair trial, "said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead defense lawyer.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Superior Court of Appeals, tersely rejected the motion last week, saying that the New Media & quot; would be carefully controlled & quot;, and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was probably not the last word in this thing.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of the trial.
In its historic decision of 1966, the United States Supreme Court reversed the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly killed his wife. In his decision, Dr. Sam Sheppard said that because of the new media, there was a "quot; carnival" atmosphere in the courtroom.
Some people think that the TV series and the movie & quot; On the Run & quot; are based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court objections, which look at Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, could follow the argument that new rules are needed to regulate the channels of courtroom communication that were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
& quot; There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in lawsuits that are followed by the general public. & quot; said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, the death penalty is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting prompt communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers have argued could drag on for years, delaying a conviction.
Defense attorneys also contend that Mr. Hayes may have been already convicted when Judge Blue did not allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with horror.
Defense attorneys say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge mistakenly replaced a juror who was a critic of the prosecution, and that he inappropriately pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to vacate the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But her arguments about the impact of in-depth coverage of the trial are perhaps the most interesting.
In a ruling challenge filed last month, they noted that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was debated by the candidates during the campaign for governor and U.S. Senate.
They argued that the new media has continually reignited the flames of emotion about the case.
& quot; Such a daily rush of media beeps, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom & quot;, the lawyers wrote, & quot; has never been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide. & quot;
Her emphasis on Twitter's coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that claiming these direct messages are more inflammatory than reports that are reported more slowly is an anti-technology view that impoverishes reporting on future trials.
But some lawyers said appeal courts are often confronted with the argument that societal and technological changes require adjustment by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce this claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the coverage, and made clear that the new media require new rules.
& quot; This case, & quot;, they wrote, represents Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century. & quot;
Can civility connect the dissociator?
After a campaign of insults and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is this the omen of real two-party cooperation, or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the fighting of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders failed to achieve any breakthrough on the big issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called & quot; lame duck session.
Judging by everything I have heard, governing was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibilities, but more of a hollow episode of partisan point-scoring.
The public meeting of the president's deficit commission on Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the policy differences that persist between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that masks the ideological chasm that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one demanding the other showing signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to weigh the boundaries of public opinion and the patience of voters after another partisan war.
As a result, Tuesday's meeting itself and its evaluation by participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great, and too deep, for one to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election gave Washington at least a mild mood, for a short period of time.
& quot; No question, the tone has changed & quot; said Pete Wehner, an official in the Bush administration who now works for & quot; The Ethics and Public Policy Center.
& quot; This is inevitable after elections.
Elections stir up partisan passions that die away.
And that's good. & quot;
On some issues, especially those on the & quot; lame duck session & quot; agenda, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one advocates them.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that they will get the favored tax cuts for the rich while denying jobless workers support.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, optimism has grown that these issues can be agreed during the & quot; lame duck session & quot; while at the same time ratifying the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of lame duck session & quot; does not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a period of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps inevitable.
& quot; After the things that need to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation, 'he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and many share this skepticism - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
& quot; I see much that happens from now on until 2012 as a prelude to, or shadow boxing, the main event of 2012 & quot;, "he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the makeup of the new Republican majority in the White House, and the tea party voters who helped to educate them.
No matter how worried Republican leaders may be about poker being too high, they know that they have to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and repeal health-care reform.
These partisan lines are already apparent in the initial reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the toughest jobs in Washington, and they have, by their own assessment, pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 out of 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan a formal recommendation, and they are struggling to get anywhere near that number.
The greatest opposition is found in the elected representatives of the body, because on financial issues, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take the form of partisan clashes next year, when Republicans challenge Obama on the federal budget, taxes, and health care, followed by a period of major bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, both parties must be careful about the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change tack and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic perspective.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological chasm between Obama and Congressional Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as merely a prelude to a much more consequential election in 2012.
In this sense, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still separate the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of & quot; kleptocracy & quot;, and it passes on some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. As the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the National Security Service are extorting large sums of money to help them maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it has been claimed.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the & quot; vertical of authority & quot; - takes its share of the money moving up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was sacked by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that he has cleaned up since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won numerous defamation suits against such allegations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian television station: 'It' s crazy, it's dirty, it' s dirty. '
& gt; An incredible number of Russians think their society is corrupt, surveys show.
But it is unusual, as in the Ambassador's report, for individuals to be named, and it is unheard of for a diplomat from a foreign country to do so.
& quot; The direct connection of the Moscow government to crime has led to what some call '& quot; disturbances', leading to the conclusion that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a 'government', according to the memo.
& quot; Criminal elements enjoy a & quot; kryshna & quot; (a term from the world of criminals / mafias, which literally means & quot; roof & quot; or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure in Moscow's criminal world.
& quot; Luzhkov tops. & quot;
& quot; FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level. & quot;
& quot; Last on the list are the regular criminals and the criminal inspectors at the lowest level.
& quot; This is an incompetent system, in which criminal groups fill a gap in some areas, because the city does not offer any help. & quot;
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, so-called is, & quot; explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and the FSB (and not from organized crime), because not only do they have more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but they are protected by law.
& quot; This is why protection by criminal gangs is no longer as sought-after as it was in the past. & quot;
The memo notes that while fundraising is extensive, the protection itself can be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business closed very quickly - for one reason or another.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but he has also noted that he has made little progress.
The memo from the embassy contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
& quot; In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on the bureaucrats, Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow-based commission of experts, said in a recent interview.
& quot; But it's part of this bureaucracy. & quot;
& quot; It is not a part of the political class because there is no political class in Russia anymore. & quot;
Without a politician, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, corruption is inevitable, he says.
Countrywide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranked 154th in a recent survey on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed by & quot; as least corrupt & quot; most corrupt & quot;).
The disclosure of the American Embassy memo, which occurred late in the evening after Moscow time, is certain to generate disapproval within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that it is solving the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
& quot; The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is a major factor in domestic politics in this country,' he said.
& quot; But to be honest, we did not expect this to happen with such arrogance, pressure, and unethical manner, you know. & quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and flaking walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembers the man who built it, Ta Mok, later to become the Khmer Rouge leader.
& quot; Everyone here loves Ta Mok. & quot;
& quot; He was a good leader and he cared about his people & quot; said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge regime, known as & quot; the Butcher & quot;, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitulation to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed the victims to publicly confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the history of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint tribunal of the UN and Cambodia sentenced a former member of the Khmer Rouge for the first time, sentencing Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Alnlong Vengs' Khmer Rouge veterans, complicating their efforts to achieve reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
& quot; There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything & quot; said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization researching the regime.
& quot; Life was glorious for them under the Khmer Rouge, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. & quot;
& quot; Divides families. & quot;
During the Khmer Rouge regime of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-ed government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia and Thailand.
Here they continued to cause trouble until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary waged guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought up the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who did not give in, was arrested by government forces near the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was awaiting his trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, illiterate peasants.
& quot; These people have benefited very little from capitulation & quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
& quot; They are embedded in the regime's utopian agariideology. & quot;
& quot; You grew up without any professional knowledge. & quot;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
Life under the Khmer Rouge was good, 'he said.
& quot; Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat. & quot;
& quot; But now life is hard, because we have to look after ourselves. & quot;
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The mandate of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it has not been said if it will prosecute any crimes beyond these four cases.
This has done little to ease the anxieties in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who served as Manteay Meanchey district chief during the Khmer Rouge regime of the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told commissioners at the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers were presumed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a filthy street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the withered grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss its Khmer Rouge past.
If the court subpoenaed her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
& quot; Cambodia lives in peace and stability & quot;,'she said.
& quot; If there were no more prosecutions, there would be war. & quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become volatile if the court indicted more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
& quot; Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past & quot;, 'he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
& quot; Reconciliation with the Khmer times means putting together the broken pieces & quot;, "he said.
& quot; It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand everything. & quot;
The Center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page & quot; history of Democratic Cambodia.
It distributed the book in June at Anlong Veng as an attachment to the Department of Education's High School History Book, which contains less than four pages of information about the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read.
& quot; My family opposes many parts of the book and the court & quot;, 'he said.
& quot; They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will sentence. & quot;
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are gradually gaining influence, he said.
There is still a powerful attraction to the Khmer Rouge.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path strewn with shrubbery and plastic debris leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was cremated on a pile of tyres here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman by the side of the road, said she did not know much about the man who had been burned here.
& quot; But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray & quot;,'she said.
It was Nuom Sotha's birthday, and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot' s final resting place where she would lay down a bush of ripe bananas - hoping that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to stop accumulating weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect high-enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had tried for years to persuade Belarus to stop collecting high-enriched uranium, and seemed to have hit a roadblock last spring.
But U.S. government officials told The Washington Post that two secret deals have been struck with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the remainder of the material - about £500, according to an official, who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation nuclear security summit held by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
& quot; I was really excited by the fact that they wanted a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (2012).
& quot; This proves to me that it works & quot; said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the & quot; agreement a very significant and important step forward for Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their high-enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
& quot; How to keep high enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and low enriched uranium & quot;, Lukashenko said at the time.
& quot; This is our raw material... We 'll never make dirty bombs and we' ll never sell & quot; to anybody.
& quot; We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all & quot;.
Belarus nevertheless drew closer to the US a few months ago when it expressed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly radioactive, officials say.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was made by plane, according to the officials.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going to Belarus' research into low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
& quot; This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build the trust & quot; that led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Risk Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that this year Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to close its camp by 2012, according to the agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement hints at a possible rapprochement.
Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens & quot;, "she explains.
No objection from the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to CIA flights carrying Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily & quot; El País & quot; (by cable). It is added that former deputy chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government be informed, & quot; to prove that foreign planes flying over Spain are being adequately monitored.
In June 2006, after the publication of a report from the Council of Europe denouncing aid to human rights violations in a dozen countries, including Spain, Eduardo Aguirre, the former North American Ambassador, discussed with Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy head of government admitted that the council's report had sidelined Zapatero and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
& quot; De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory.
& quot; They just want to be informed & quot;, so as not to be caught off-guard & quot;, Aguirre reports by cable.
Even the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government did not want to pay much attention to this matter, even though the government had little influence, because it was in the hands of the judges.
For his part, Vicente González, the Attorney General, indicated to the Embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents relating to the CIA flights from the Spanish Central Intelligence Service (CNI) and the Minister of Defense.
& quot; These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information, the ambassador explained after talking to the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutor than about the declassified information from the CNI and the Defense Department.
& quot; This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discredit governments, complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007 attended by the United States Ambassador and the Spanish Interior Minister, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are incredibly attached to their independence and do what they think is appropriate", he gave his staff instructions to avoid making inflammatory rhetorical comments in order to lower the tension. "
The Ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
& quot; Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience tells us that the PP will not doubt that the Zapatero government has tolerated or willfully ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government.
The child murderer confesses to having complained on the Internet about the hardship of motherhood.
The young woman talked about the child when it was already dead and she had a blog: Galician & quot; Terror
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is in Internet & quot; Muki & quot;.
Under this nickname, which she keeps from childhood on, she keeps in contact with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, in which she was born.
The notices are from 2008.
In order to understand these, one has to know about their love lives, which the daily ABC reconstructs based on testimonies of their families.
The 30 year old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
It lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up with her relationship, it was revealed she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was him, but his ex-wife never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly after, she entered into another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the little boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But the contents of her messages suggest that her love affair broke up and they parted.
In March 2008, she was alone in Menorca, writing: & quot; Alberto is very strange and angry, because I came here for work. & quot;
& quot; When I told him, he liked it, but now of course he realises what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and leave what he wants. & quot;
Later on, she mentions a message she has just received on her phone: & quot; I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send the boy to. & quot;
She complains: & quot; If he does not like that I leave the boy with my mother, I will pick him up when I get back. & quot;
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "& quot; This week, I will go there, but I will only stay until the 19th, because I have to imagine working on the 20th, if I do not want to lose it. & quot;
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
& quot; He will be with her when he has to be with her, that is, with me. Never again in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother, & quot;, a dubious intention considering their bad relationship.
In July there will be another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy, who arrived on the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
& quot; On the one hand César is happy, on the other hand he is not. & quot;
& quot; On the one hand, he is with me and enjoys the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day. & quot;
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
& quot; There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I will have less expenses for the nanny. & quot;
On the 17th: Alarms and complaining.
& quot; A giant kiss from César, asking when you are coming. & quot;
& quot; Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants to, he finds me, some kind of crap. & quot;
On the 30th another one: & quot; The boy is well. He is going to a summer-course to learn catalan. & quot;
There is a: & quot; He shoots money for me. & quot;
There are messages from her on the Internet, in anime and manga logs.
She even had her own blog on MySpace, which is now blocked, calling herself & quot; Muki, the prisoner & quot;
& quot; Terror a la gallega (Headline) & quot;.
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting warden, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can 't believe it all happened because she did not tell him that she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Judicial Prisoners in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of events, and that she had no intention of damaging the child.
Before that, however, she confessed to having drowned César in the bathtub and storing his corpse in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking ahead to the parliamentary elections - early or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party gains in these elections is usually twice the number of votes in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, in the 2008 general elections, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes, compared with 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend - the result of the PSC vote redirection and PP voter loyalty - continues, PP analysts predict that in the general election, the PPC will increase from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU will gain 4 (it now has 10) and the PSC will lose at least 9 (out of 25).
These calculations confirm the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
Under the People's Party analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV would retain its MP or gain one more.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next municipal elections will be held in May 2011. Even then, the Popular Party (PP) may be the tongue in cheek to put an end to socialist dominance in four provincial capitals and with its majority on the city council of Barcelona, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists do not have a majority or traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not crazy that this party will lose its representation on the municipal council of Barcelona, where it should achieve 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, has increased its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals, and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida, and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona's turnaround, where they had ruled together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last electoral campaign.
There has also been a significant increase in the Popular Party in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities in Catalonia, and aims to create lists in as many locations as possible.
The Catalan cell obtained thousands of passports for Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and the seven Nigerians arrested by the police of the Intelligence Unit of the Police Department of Barcelona were part of the Thailand-controlled jihadist cell that supplied passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Tamil Eelam & quot; movement (LTTE) and Lashkar-e-Taiba & quot; (Let), the author of the 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 106.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations, to the point that he asserts that & quot; Operation Kampai & quot; has weakened Al Qaeda's worldwide counterfeiting apparatus, and thus its ability to act.
The researchers assume that in the two years during which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al Qaeda, so that their 'quot; fighters' could cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with impunity.
The cell uncovered is not the only one in the jihadist network to have been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigation. It is not possible that there will be similar attacks on EU territory in the coming days as the one carried out last Tuesday in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another operation was conducted in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had headed the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network, part of which was destroyed in 2009, particularly stole passports from tourists in accordance with the requirements of the so-called & quot; International Islamic Front.
This means that the documents had to be issued in the names of men aged between 25 and 45 years and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have any visa stamps.
Investigators stress that no connection has been established between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, even though the author of the attack, & quot; Lashkar e-Taiba & quot;, was one of the groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the attack, several thousand dollars had been shipped from Catalonia, through a money transfer company, invested in the purchase of & quot; mobile phone prepaid cards, which were later used by members of & quot; command & quot;, which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police seized an extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone tax deal
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally submit to Artur Mas her conditions of support for his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from those made during the campaign and can be summarized by the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial settlement agreement that the regionalist leader wants to propose at the climax of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party addressed Artur Mas with the certainty of having won the 18 MEPs she had won last Sunday - a figure more than enough to make her feel indispensable. The candidate from the ciu ciu-ciu bourgeois regionalist party is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from the vote on his inauguration.
Future alliances that the regionalists plan to enter into in the upcoming congressional elections depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, Mas' current talks with the other party leaders are centred around Catalonia.
As for the leader of the PPC, she demands that in support of & quot;, all the discourse about the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia, as well as an agreement about the financial settlement between the state and the Autonomous Region - as in the Basque country - and which the party leader of the CiU wants to hold a referendum, should be put on the back burner.
What both political leaders have in common is that they want to streamline the burgeoning political machinery of regional government and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas' taking office are being worked on by PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Elderly Care Home confirms that the deaths are not caused by & quot; lack of action
The owners of the nursing home in Olot do not rule out that their keeper killed over eleven elderly people
The authorities responsible for the nursing home for the elderly, La Caritat, in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday, in which they stressed the damage done by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the carer who killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for - to the institution.
The director of the Nursing Home for the Elderly, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that & quot; La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible for the deaths, & quot; but the law and our liability obligation force us to accept the trial and the civil liability.
The institution not only has to accept a loss of social standing because it did not detect the criminal actions of the keeper in time, but also has to pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the lawyers of the victims' families.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has been murdering since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had examined the deceased personally, but that the formalities were handled by telephone based on their age and illnesses.
The director of La Caritat flatly denied this point and explained that & quot; lack of action could have been the reason for the incidents at the time.
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there is' no evidence of negligent conduct by anyone other than the accused 'in the lawsuit.
The man already baptised as' Quot; Angel of Death 'confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and one and a half months later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat explained that the access of the medicines to the staff was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail in six of nine crimes committed by the patient to free the patient from his suffering.
But the results of the lab tests will determine whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach, as he confessed to murdering three women between October 12th and 17th.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the testimony of the keeper, even in respect of the number of murders confessed, which could very well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had given very different testimonies in court, and that there is no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason, and to shed light on the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures from the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness.
Risk spreads in the eurozone's periphery countries have risen dramatically, and European bank stocks are up more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility of deception, of the euro barely gaining points, which is worrying.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers as it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
Institutional investors are far from losing their fear.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank asked us to withdraw our liquidity measures, which will require the ECB to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably many more times in the future.
The Bundesbank demanded that the plan to purchase sovereign debt be terminated, as it was ineffective, as well as the cancellation of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a one-week open access access would be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended at least until March, and the quarterly unlimited access calls for tender at the end of the quarter will be maintained until at least June, in order to ensure liquidity.
We also expect the bond-buying programme to continue and send out a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday's markets will be set back, and if stubbornly insist that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
This story could be repeated tomorrow, as it was at the ECB meeting in May, when the Bank reiterated that it would not consider buying sovereign debt securities and the markets collapsed.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, it showed its teeth, and on Wednesday, it said that it had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government securities in Portugal was rather weak.
The state Asset Management spent only $500 million at 5.28%, up from $750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, in Portugal, interest rates fell by 30 basis points over the entire curve, reflecting a shift in perceptions in the markets, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt-hole figures were published by Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland lost all credibility after failing to spot the problem with the July stress tests, the numbers provided by the bailout plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must win parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday. Ireland remains a source of uncertainty, as it does not yet have sufficient support.
Angela Merkel has toned down her discourse ahead of the summit of heads of state and government on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are sharing the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The President of the Spanish Government presented yesterday the plan of measures to be adopted on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as in the case of the financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures. Measures that sound to the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four of Seasons.
The dual effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange rose 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of Europe.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Central Bank of Spain has been rapid and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are counting on strong demand to remove any doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain, requesting an emergency plan would be a sacrifice in itself.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should stick to the theme of Caesar's Wife: & quot; Now it' s not only being that counts, but also appearances. & quot;
Only courage, we can achieve that!
Eulen's chairman challenges Vega Sicilia shareholders' meeting at the request of his children
The storm in open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the societies Eulen and El Enebro, did not subside.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will contest the shareholders meeting of El Enebro, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, because he considers it to be & quot; absolutely null and void. His children will try to obtain a majority in order to control the company's governing body - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal steps for a new chapter of justice in their dispute for control of part of the group.
The founder of El Enebro's largest corporate services holding appears reluctant to back down in his legal battle for control of El Enebro' s institutions.
He was ousted from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed to the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which is already disputed in the Commercial Register.
The Shareholders Meeting of El Enebro, convened by the Judge of the Commercial Court Number 2 of Madrid on the 16th, has unleashed a new thunderclap in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Referring to the judge for arranging the meeting is the only legal way of ensuring that the meeting is convened.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to get the nullified Assembly of January 18th approved, & quot;, as officials explain.
This reasoning is the basis for challenging the assembly in retrospect, in order to declare it to be & quot; completely null and void.
The same protagonists, who hide themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judge in June.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez & apos; seven children control 100% of the capital.
In contrast, the founder of the service group demands, according to the Family Protocols, the right of use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background to the case on which the judge will have to decide in the hearing on the contesting claim, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The trolleys are improved with software in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer, and despite his soaring career over the last few seasons, everyone counted on the victory of the Ferraris of Fernando Alonso in the final sprint last November.
Without denigrating the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the power of the Renault engine, the & quot; secret weapon & quot;, which was put into the hands of the multinational Siemens Red Bull and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes that the German company released in 2007 for purposes other than car racing.
This informatics program, called PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories all over the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce or simulation a product or process faithfully before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Siemens' Industry Department, explains that with the use of this software at the Formula 1 Red Bull & quot; factory, within a few hours, almost in real time, & quot; can design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected during the races and during the tests.
Russwurm points out that in 1992 there were an average of ten technicians working in the race stables, who could introduce no more than three or four improvements in one season.
Red Bull's team now employs 180 highly-skilled young people. Using powerful computer systems, they perform analyses and make all kinds of modifications to the race cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull race cars, except for the engine, for which Renault declares itself solely responsible.
The materials, the fuel, the aerodynamics and the safety elements are modified.
Thanks to advanced production equipment and high-tech autoclaves, the changes can be transmitted from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours.
The only limit placed on this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory to develop and produce its racing cars in a town 50 kilometres away from London.
There are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are severely restricted.
Everything that happens there is top secret.
The workforce consists of 580 people, including the two drivers, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's real Formula One hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion, Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer devotes to helping him compete on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
The plant's head of technology, Steve Nevey, points out that even five years ago it could only be said that the advances in racing car R & amp; D contributed 50% to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber could never be replaced by computerized systems, because they are & quot; unpredictable gladiators & quot;.
HP to Open Twenty Own Stores of Local Distributors in Two Years
Yesterday Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of twenty outlets, each ranging in size from 80 to 100 square meters, that Multi plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees to this initiative with the existing 16 multi-brand outlets, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España Vice Chairman Helena Herrero gave the example of the converted shop on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American group aims to have 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of which are in Spain.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera would not reveal upcoming openings but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairperson, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the store opening philosophy is always the same. She relied on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the industry.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive store décor (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for training store staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a franchising scheme and stressed that the purpose of the exclusive network of points of sale is to optimize & quot; customer service and advice to small and micro businesses in purchasing and after purchasing, even packaging.
The Barcelona store has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP warranty devices.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
& quot; In this way, we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days. & quot;
& quot; This system was especially designed for small and micro businesses as well as private customers, because large companies already have their technical service contracts.
Sabadell wants to steal one million customers from rival & apos; in three years
Banco Sabadell's chief executive Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a slump in the interest rate margins, which the banks are trying to compensate for by increasing the fees and the prices of loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million residential customers in three years - a subject that remains to be resolved.
Sabadell has found a way to exhaust the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year blueprint in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without receiving the public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase its market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you take away the customers the bank will lose. This is the big challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year, it added 250,000 retail customers and 50,000 businesses.
Its retail market share is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, ie austerity, reduce costs. The challenges the bank faces will be presented together with the annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set targets and publish them in these difficult times, when the global financial crisis has thrown all the plans of the banks into confusion.
Sabadell will complete its Optima four-year plan this year. The plan was initially planned for three years, but due to market conditions it was extended for one fiscal year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 will be a difficult & quot; year & quot; with great reach & quot;
The manager thinks Spain will only come out of the crisis & quot; slowly.
Also, creating & quot; in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks - would be very difficult.
Although he expects the war over liabilities - which penalizes interest-rate margins - to end, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay to obtain liquidity, compensating for declining profit margins, are already being passed on to the price of loans.
& quot; The topics of liquidity and finance are structural, and they will put pressure on loans. & quot;
We haven 't turned off the tap but the interest rate differentials are very high,' Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued an order to its network of branches to restrict long-term lending and increase interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of 22-27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks currently had the option of raising the fees, but within a competitive framework.
Sabadell's blueprint is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate deals.
Not for nothing does he assure us that & quot; needs larger companies in Spain. & quot;
& quot; In the coming year, everything will change & quot;, he assures.
He stresses that the demand for capital is rising rapidly and does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will go into the red.
He believes that the FROB can replace the money market when there is a capital increase.
By asserting that Sabadell could survive even a temporary shutdown of the markets, he invalidates the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
There is nothing that can be put into circulation, but unlike what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through repo transactions, thus avoiding the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers of Sparkassen
CECA CEO José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday dismissed the possibility of a wave of mergers between the savings banks, stressing the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the CEO of the Spanish Savings Banks Confederation (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured me that this second round would not take place.
& quot; I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the group Banca Cívica cannot be considered as a second round, it was more about adjustments. & quot;
Most of & quot; has been completed. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all major processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all operations. & quot;
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managers and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stressed that the & quot; concentration process was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timeliness, which was determined in former times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España, stressed Olavarrieta.
& quot; The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically unprecedented process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, which is why we complied with the Basle agreement.
Olavarrieta explained that there were a number of angry opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed seriousness and folly, because & quot; Banco de España warns us to close on time before the end of the year.
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and 'quot; maybe' in the world, adding that those who doubt this are 'quot; without deeper knowledge'.
The manager noted that in the current economic climate, there is no need to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have gone through a very significant & quot; concentration process, which will be completed & quot; as quickly as possible.
He also pointed out that the Spanish banks passed very well the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the Red Line of Germany
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time imposed conditions on the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a dual response by the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro businesses, regulation of temporary agencies and the cancellation of the 426 euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the administration of the airports of Barajas and El Prat as well as 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for provoking the current crisis.
How do you understand these operations?
Let's face it, Merkel' s position is not a mistake in her publicity.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking on a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, one that conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of many of its partners.
In view of the opposition in Europe, people in Germany are starting to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the eurozone.
Second: the re-introduction of the Deutschmark - although at this time it sounds more like science fiction - with the support of a large part of the public, about 50% of the population.
The third: reshaping the euro according to German proposals. This means more macroeconomic control; rigorous budgeting; punishing countries that exceed the benchmarks; possibly suspending the payments of some countries, and extending the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been on the cards for some time now. So there are no excuses now.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission provided incentives for deficits, and the German government drafted a constitutional reform to prevent this from happening from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of the drift away from what Germany believed was necessary (tight fiscal plans and stable public finances) and from the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal came from the central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to bail out Greece.
That was heavily criticized at the time, but the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public opinion and the public opinion was absolutely against a bailout of Greece.
Finally, Merkel emerges again in the last days of October with a clear position. She demands a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to allow the rescue of a country, while obliging private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, because it fuelled the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But her proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, was accepted. In the months ahead, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which should make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old way of functioning of the euro will cease to exist from this date onwards.
2013 will be the year of a new currency area, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, forced to default, and in this case the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany shows us that we must pursue a tough course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improved productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain during the boom, is simply unacceptable.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just about getting the general government deficit down to three per cent of GDP by 2013.
Demands are much tougher.
And the worst that we could do in these conditions is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence passes in more serenity.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It appears that Zapatero understood this too, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the talks with big business last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has taken hold.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like anything will change.
Among the options being considered, the idea that we would have to leave the euro area stuffed with few serious countries cannot be ruled out.
In that case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks like those by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to avoid a penalty.
The alleged incitement of two Real Madrid players, Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos, in the match on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed on whether or not this was an unsporting act and whether or not both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
It is well known that a few minutes before the end of the game the two players lost time (their team had already won clearly) and made several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead the group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction in the next league match against Auxerre, thus entering the next match phase without any cards.
The UEFA disciplinary committee fined the club's coach, José Mourinho, two matches and the players involved different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that are adhered to in this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the depicted case comes down to the fact that a team from the football club Real Madrid (who claim nobility and honour in their anthem and on other occasions punished their players for similar incidents) played the leading role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocateur technician.
In any case, the debate focuses on whether this behaviour, which is expressly prohibited by the statutes, contravenes the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute rule circumvention. In fact, this conduct conforms to the statutes of sport, but appears to circumvent the meaning of the statutes.
In this case, the damage done to the spirit of sport should be investigated.
The spirit of sport defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking undue advantage of the opposition team. Again, this did not happen.
The paradox of the action taken by the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand as cheating or rule evasion, because the evasion of the rule was not done secretly to avoid a penalty, but rather to be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
Players waited and joyfully accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders took from the deliberate fouls.
It is important to emphasize that the rival was not placed in an unfavorable position or advantages were desired for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game because the club does not have these players.
The advantage, obviously, is that the players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, to a certain extent uncertain, because the team could go out at some point. Additionally, this approach punishes the players and moves them into the second card cycle, where they go out with one card less than in the first cycle.
This means that it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices do not undermine the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions to maximize the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent any sanction (this would be a clear case of rule circumvention), they wanted to choose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision not to evade or escape punishment.
Although the line between ingenuity and the rule environment is blurred, I believe that this case is a clear case of ingenuity.
I have the impression that the controversy arose from two factors: because there were two self-exclusions, and because of the way the rules were transmitted.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Customer Catch Offer Offensive for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar has caused an avalanche of reservations to fall on December 16th and 17th this year.
The celebrations paid for by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas Lottery, there are group dinners once again in the run-up to Christmas which provide oxygen to the Barcelona catering and leisure sector. But due to the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the mass customer segment: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To make accounting even more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) canceled all orders for the week of December 13, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations for two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders for the week preceding that.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many workers pay out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, minimum prices are demanded, confirms Gaietà Farràs, President of the Restaurants Council of Barcelona.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare to predict yet what the holidays will be like this month.
& quot; People think twice about & apos; umpteen times before they make a reservation. & quot;
& quot; They like to go out, but they pay attention to prices. & quot;, "he points out.
Business will be good for those who want to offer quality at good prices with a good service, "he adds, reminding us that customers save during times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand.
A survey of several restaurants found that the evening of December 17 led to a collapse of the vendors.
The Soteras group says demand for this Friday with a view of spending less than 30 euros is booming. The group has adapted its menus to the economic situation, offering full menus ranging from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar led to early reservations even from the beginning of November.
& quot; We made the impossible possible in order to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from 19.95 to 30 euros & quot;,' he explains.
AN Grup, which owns El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and 23 pubs in total, is not losing any of its optimism, seeing revenues blossoming again in the second quarter and anticipating a good Christmas trading outlook, albeit focused on a few days.
Group sources stress that the 18th will also be an overactive day with pre-Christmas groups of friends.
A Christmas menu has been added to the six group menus for 30 Euro or more as a price hit. It seems that customers are willing to spend 10% more than last year and want more details, such as cava.
Even in some companies you can see green sprouts, so the employees are invited back. This gives the impression that the group dinners are on the rise again.
On behalf of the umbrella organization Fecasarm (with associations such as the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the Vice Chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts that he will see the end of the tunnel and notes that overall reservations are quite & quot; lively, even though the customers knock & quot; out the maximum.
The joy of partying, however, has not waned, no matter who pays.
Pakistan nuclear program causes major concern in US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons more quickly than any other country.
Revelations by Wikileaks confirm Taliban-Pakistani relationship.
The contents of correspondence between the US embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirm how deeply concerned Washington is about Pakistan's nuclear program.
In addition to the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that nuclear security cooperation between the two countries is not being strengthened, on the contrary it is being & quot; decreasing & quot;, and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons & quot; at a faster rate than any other country.
In particular, the nature of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their components are stored to make it harder to destroy in the event of a possible attack - gives Washington sleepless nights.
The risks listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report published before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: the proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material.
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered excessive and a reason for caution, not only by the US but also by Russia.
& quot; Pakistan needs to hire strict religious personnel to guard its nuclear facilities; because of the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to participate in nuclear or missile programs, said Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a briefing with his North American counterparts.
What is new about the documentary, revealed by Julian Assange's web portal, is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is waning, as is the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the Embassy, which describes communication with Pakistan as' frustrating '& quot;, explained:' Quite often there is no transparency; offers of aid do not get any answers or are rejected. '
In another message, Peter Lavoy, State Intelligence Officer for South Asia, confirms that despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons more quickly than any other country.
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington to clarify & quot; to the person responsible that & quot; Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups during a visit by the Chief of the General Staff, General Ashfaq Kayani.
Hunting for Wikileaks Chief
Obama names a senior counter-terrorism official to prevent new revelations
Interpol issues a red warning to track down and locate Assange.
Everything connected with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, creates a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts are difficult to elucidate.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a & quot; red warning on & quot; tracing and tracking & quot; from Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Also, it is not new, it is dated 20th november.
It has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of more than four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse facing the Australian in Sweden.
The lawyer for the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also asserted that the police knew where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
Already on the 20th, at the request of Sweden, the international police authority based in Lyon, France issued the order, but it was not notified until yesterday, when the Swedish authorities obtained the power.
This is how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are assigned to identify and find Assange, & quot; to arrest him and extradite him. & quot;
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many member states, according to the organization, consider the red alert to be a carte blanche for arrest - which must be handled by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is presumed to be staying.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who published a letter informing him that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder is willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via video conference.
You also point out that Assange requested permission to leave Sweden and was granted permission to leave by the Prosecutor, who is likened to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's chief of security.
& quot; This is like a hunt, not a legal prosecution & quot; is accused in the letter.
While the world searches for him - and his mother proclaims her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location. During the interview, he asked for the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
& quot; if it can prove that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN, in violation of international agreements signed by the United States, she should resign; quot; he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, who called the request for resignation "ridiculous and absurd."
& quot; I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website & quot;, 'he told CNN.
Obama himself has assigned a high-level official in charge of the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the opinions expressed these days by conservative politicians and commentators.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of adding WikiLeaks to the list of terrorist organizations, seizing their funds and tracking everyone who supports or contributes to them.
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, went further, saying that Assange 'needs to be murdered & quot;
& quot; Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something. & quot;
The person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas, and possible presidential candidate.
& quot; Whoever leaked information in the government is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is too lenient a sentence, 'he told Fox News.
Puigcercós looks for Peace in the ERC with a wink to Carod
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret ballot on his continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and an end to the principle of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a formula to avoid for the umpteenth time internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC, after losing 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The leader of the party knows that his threat to resign is not enough for those close to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its mentor and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra is winking at the new critics, thus securing his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that ERC's more than 200 regional councillors could vote to keep him in office.
With ballots, not with elevated hands.
If the carodists wanted to give the President a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division as well as submission to himself.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he did not feel confirmed with half the votes plus one, adding without giving percentages that a & quot; Bulgarian-style result would not be good either.
Those close to Carod are demanding more from the president than merely making his office available to the party. This is insufficient, since Puigcercós controls the governing body of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree a plan of action with the board from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation, which the leadership will submit to the vote in the Council on the 18th.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós in return for a promise to bring forward the Congress to fall 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The ERC's leader believes that the & quot; polyphony and quot; damage the stability of the ERC and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to do its dirty work behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the current conseller Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the leader of the party was supported by & quot; in exchange for different goals.
He listed five, two of which stand in the foreground.
Firstly, the & quot; reorganization of the Board of Directors so that it represents at least 90 percent of the members of the Party, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second one might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the assembly principle as a way of working.
In doing so, he is advocating a reform of the bylaws to allow congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcerco's & apos; team, which has fought for this at the last two congresses, is obsessed about ending the Plenary Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the 2008 earthquake, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of assembly at a congress aimed at reforming the statutes.
This date has not yet been set, because infogle had the internal turmoil of the last years not to handle this matter.
Now, without critical sectors lying in wait, the time has come to resume this matter and close it for good.
23 killed in November, 290 in 2010

In Ecatepec, fragments of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the settlement Golondrina.
The emergency service searched for the rest of the body, but could not find it.
Residents of Tepotzotlán were notified of the discovery of a body they had discovered in the Peña Colorada area. Their hands were tied behind their backs and their heads were bandaged.
The man had a wound resulting from a firearm shot to the neck.
In the middle of the month, there were reports of the murder of two men, who were discovered wrapped in blankets and in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. Besides the victims, two death threats were also found.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes, Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the remains of the body were found in a black plastic bag with a note signed by El Inca.
On the 17th, two dead women were discovered covered in blankets in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca. The next morning, in Huixquilucan, the corpse of a man, probably Mario Ríos, was found covered in a yellow-blue blanket by his killers.
In the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca the lifeless body of a woman was found with firearms in her neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte and necklaces with corresponding images were discovered on the skin of the woman.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man was found in the municipality of Zinacantepec, next to a vehicle, with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men, their heads covered with duct tape, and a message were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the bodies lay a message, probably signed by a criminal organization, which read: 'This will happen to those who do not participate'.
In Ecatepec, two bodies with hands and feet tied with signs of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the Justice Center of the settlement of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The former had been decapitated in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancon, and was wrapped in black plastic bags with a notice next to it. The former had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the settlement of Juárez.
Next to him, police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The Chinese representative stated at COP16 that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce traces of carbon and that he would maintain his offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China maintains its offer to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He noted that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million in reducing its emissions of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its objectives, but that it would work with the international community on this issue.
He explained that China's strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and supporting pilot programmes.
Progress has been achieved in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year setting out the objectives for reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, the state authorities have worked with those of the central state and local authorities to achieve the objectives of saving energy, using energy efficiently, and reducing emissions.
In addition, some multi-annual plans have already been initiated or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those financed by other countries.
For example, he referred to the Effective Energy Program, which has been in place for the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government, and private entities.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving light bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, Government Scientific Adviser on Climate Change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are much more intensive than people think.
He pointed out that China's per capita emissions of greenhouse gases are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a 9% total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the area of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 percent over the last five years, and there is another one scheduled for 2020, he explained.
Espinos Legal Exclusion: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former pan-European party leader had the right to go to the National Commission of Order and demand what the right granted him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, asserted that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was lawful, and that the former leader of the PAN had the right to appeal to the National Order Commission for what was lawful.
In an interview conducted before Gabino Cué Monteagudo became governor of the state, he stated that Espino's dismissal was a local decision.
& quot; An independent decision taken by the Sonoran Police Inspectorate.
& quot; Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Commission of the Order of Consejo Nacional to have a decision taken by a competent authority, 'quot;', he added.
On the other hand, he said, it is not time to think about 2012, and that an alliance of presidential candidates has never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge stronger from the internal vote on December 4-5, which will elect his successor.
& quot; Das (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not yet. It was a proposal for municipal elections, it was successful, and it served its purpose, 'he said.
The Pan leader explained that the PAN has 71 years of dialogue to look back on, so internal competition does not frighten us; on the contrary & quot; we enjoy it and it strengthens us & quot;, "he commented.
He said that the council would no doubt select the best chairperson or chairperson Acción Nacional needs for the next three years. Therefore, it would hand over the stake to the one the council would designate.
& quot; I am quite unconcerned and open about this. I would be proud to give each of the five the position of party chairman. & quot;
He predicted that the upswing experienced by the party in the last elections, held on July 4th, will be reflected in the next elections, although it is not time to think about 2012.
& quot; Now it is time to support Governor Gabino Cué in his job. & quot;
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla, and Sinaloa would be flying flags and observed throughout the country. That's why & quot; puts so many hopes and longings in them, and I' m sure Gabino is on the right track. & quot;
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón' s discourse during his four-year government, Cesar Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
& quot; If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet & quot;, he reiterated.
He believes that the owner of the federal government can use phrases like those he can use in his discourse in the Auditorium Nacional, because in this country there is no mouth ban and even less censorship.
Obama Takes to Twitter to Appeal for Law Benefiting Undocumented Students
& quot; If you are in favor of the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passage of this bill & quot;, "the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - law legalizing undocumented students by posting a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
& quot; If you are in favor of the passage of the Dream Act, call your senators and push for the passage of this bill & quot;, "Obama tweeted.
His memo contains a cyberlink to a broader document urging the public to contact their senators privately because the bill's imminent adoption is imminent.
& quot; With the voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you & quot;, "he stresses.
The news came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes on each bill except for extending the Bush-era tax breaks and government funding.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the Dream Act bill and other projects, such as the ratification of the New START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Asked about the Republicans' blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the other projects.
& quot; I think we still have a lot of time... & quot;
& quot; We all agree that the tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year...
& quot; I think we can make an agreement about it anytime, and after that we can plan the rest's course,' he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would request a vote at the end of the debate to approve the Dream Act, which would allow the legalization of undocumented students to vote in the Senate next Thursday, although it is more likely to do so next week.
The version of the Dream Act - the law or the law of the American Dream would legalize approximately 800,000 young people, who immigrated to the United States when they were under sixteen years old, lived in this country for the last five years, and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the military.
But the bill's supporters require sixty votes to pass, so they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the project' s advocacy organizations are organizing an intensive effort to influence the passage of the bill.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against the bill, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That's why defenders of the Dream Act must have several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The most heavily wooed Republicans include those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who came out in favor of the bill, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of & apos; The Pleasure of Language & apos; was a walk where the participants stood up for the narrative
& quot; The thing about sex in language, I understand, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me? & quot; asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was scheduled to open the second round of & apos; Los placeres de la lengua & apos;, a series that celebrated Spanish-language literature and used the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, the roundtable was dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The Finger in the Wound... & quot; gets us into trouble & quot;, the Argentine writer spat sweetly at the audience, made up mainly of young people gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to attend this roundtable moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text, which she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and Shultz described it as a great story. Luisa tells the story first-person and is the protagonist, who is in search of what a & quot; wound is & quot;, and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but tips for the guide of her story.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: patience is not my strength, maybe it is my wound. & quot;
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who takes her breath in the middle of the corridor, but tells her that the wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar.
The main character of the story sighs with relief and concludes that the wound only told & quot; that it was really open and did not exist. But he is convinced that the pleasure of the language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called & apos; Praise of Invention & apos;, in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned but discovered.
With allusions to magic realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back distant men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative turns and tells of America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack its own chronicler, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
& quot; Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), mocked the feigned witnesses who appeared in the stories portrayed as being true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, even the sense of shame. & quot;
However, he stresses that & quot; is where the madmen and liars best imagine & quot;, and where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches its zenith.
He actually calls it the & apos; Tradition Cervantes & apos;.
& quot; We inherited from him what is narrated. & quot;
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented on and praised the variety of interpretations that FIL' s invitation to the roundtable & apos; The Finger in the Wound & apos; contributed to.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican has dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that befalls her country - as it does in all of Latin America - as a result of the drug-trafficking struggle.
& quot; I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain implicit, unintentional engagement & quot;, she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment, which build up between the author and the readers as in a & quot; chemical reaction & quot;.
The evening was rounded off by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted the finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer & quot;.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and consciousness control also amount to dogmatism, and what is forgotten is that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each denial there is a small yes. & quot;
& quot; In order to possess our thought and reality, we have to be nuanced: And nuance often means putting our finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in premade ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful, who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he observed, inviting them to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has a history of three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but three times he has played decisive matches.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final game, two different styles dictated by their respective coaches are pitted against each other, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held his ground well, so this is a very important opportunity for him.
The Argentinian has exalted himself to the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and amazingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santicist strategist reached his first final match as coach at & apos; Torneo Apertura 2002 & apos;, when del Morelia had the reins in hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at & apos; Clausura 2003 & apos;, he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the & apos; Torneo Bicentenario 2010 & apos;, where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback, because the game was tied 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes, but on the penalty shot Rubén got ahead 3-1 and had two chances to claim his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals, one with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be haunted by bad luck again and free himself from the evil spell to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
& quot; I want to be a champion, I don 't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for the affection I put myself into, and that' s why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing & quot;, the helmsman commented when asked about the lost finals.
The last game is still very much in his memory, he claims to have learned a lot from it: & quot; The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee doesn 't whistle the end, we can' t celebrate, we at the line are prepared, the players too, because last time we were already prepared to leave with two penalties, and I think that's a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no reason to celebrate. & quot;
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-out does not worry him, because he trusts his players: & quot; You never want to go to the penalty shoot-out, you want to finish in normal time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared, on the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate gave us a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the fierce desire to have the title in our hands, that left us something for this final, and we hope that it will not happen this time
It is in Romanso's power to stop being just the second champion and taste the glory of titles for the first time.
The United States Changes the Rules for obtaining a Visa
Individuals must present themselves to the visa services before they go to the consulate, reducing the cost of the wait.
Starting January 10, 2011, the procedures for obtaining a visa at the Embassy of the United States and at the consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to present themselves to the visa application service providers (ASC, the first letters in English) before they can talk to each other in the consulate.
The ASC staff collects the biometric data of the applicant, which is verified by the consulate before the interview is held.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases because there is no longer any need to pay separately for the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service providing the document.
The applicant makes only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including temporary workers' visas) and $390 for dealers and investors.
Those wishing only to renew their visa do not need to go to the consulate for a conversation, they only need to go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and get their fingerprints taken.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second appointment at the consulate will stay there less than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo do do not have to pay the 26 dollar service charge anymore.
More information about the new visa application procedure can be found at: http: / / mexico. usembassy. gov / boletines / sp101201 _ Visas-FAQs. html
NASA Announces Finding Extraterrestrial Life
The North American Space Agency has convened a press conference to announce tomorrow a discovery that will have implications for the search for life in space.
Tomorrow, Thursday, the US National Aerospace Administration (NASA) will announce an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA Headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. This is a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present 'quot; a supervisory find for the search for alien life', sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could support the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments that were previously considered uninhabitable. The hypothesis was raised that these creatures could transform into intelligent creatures - like humans - when their living conditions improve.
Apparently, this is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that is considered to be too toxic for all conceivable life forms, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some way, the microbial community uses arsenic as its survival resource. Taking this capability into account, the chances increase that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that there is actually another life form, a second life form, which differs from the one we know of.
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its find at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
Present at the conference will be geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who explores the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), who will ask if its chemical composition is similar to Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
Reform of the Organs Act on Congress will introduce the bipartisan system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already assembled, led by PRD MPs PT, Convergencia, and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who introduced himself as an Independent. The four questioned the entry into the chamber of the & apos; bipartisanship.
Before the opening session of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD, and Patrón Montalvo railed against the reform of the organ law, saying it would exclude them.
Reform, they repeated, would introduce a two-party system, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties, controlling Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Bureau, headed by the panjandran Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms the PRI and the PAN have institutionally established their political marginality.
He stated that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and the PRI to change the scheme, assuming that they have the political will, and if they do not, they will be subjugated by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
& quot; Up to this point I (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, that do not even consider to take into account the opinion of the others. & quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group was formed.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be duopolistic.
& quot; It is not the spirit of legislative reform that should prevail in Congress on an eternal two-party system. & quot;
& quot; To begin with, this group will start with five deputies and they will talk to other deputies to become more & quot;, explained the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to the PAN and the PRI, pointed out that the Congress was currently turning into a & apos; loot & apos; for two.
& quot; Before it was only one party, now they split it two. & quot;
Patrón Montalvo requested that the MEPs be respected and that they be allowed to sit at the negotiating table.
& quot; It is not allowed to be left aside because of top decisions five, which will probably be nine Members. The five, currently seen as divided into different groups, decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because because of the reform, which was done and agreed by the others, we stayed outside and we do not agree with this reform. & quot;
200 000 Peso more for & quot; the supplier
The municipal administration of Mazatlán pays another check to the controversial owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque for just over 200,000 pesos was issued by the city council to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
This brings the total amount paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the website for transparency of the city, this cheque with the number 9258447, issued for an amount of 200,144,56 pesos, was issued on 16 November last, with the purpose & quot; clearing of outstanding bills & quot;.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already anticipated that more money would go from the municipality to this vendor. It is being monitored by the Superior del Estado Auditoría because it is selling at inflated prices.
What was not mentioned is the total amount owed to her and, consequently, the number of cheques still to be written in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
& quot; Nothing was bought from her, she just pays the debt, just like the rest of the suppliers, 'he said in an interview.
The last cheques & quot; reappeared & quot; in the last quarter of the year & quot;: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as is required by law when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to avoid other administrations requesting his services, the Treasurer assured that his services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25 the audit of checks issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that previously, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality paid more than 10 million Pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she withdrew cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist destinations need to be improved penetrating
Tourism companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay special attention to areas in poor condition that give a bad impression of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Merchant Association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions there were calls to cultivate the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and pavements had had a negative impact, with tourists stopping to take a stroll and seeing the disorder, then turning their backs to nearby shops.
& quot; The politicians do not know what it means to have to close a company one day, and they do not worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise they would not do the construction work slowly and haphazard.
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist 'fall highlighted the lack of prevention and maintenance by the city.
& quot; The community needs to take its responsibility and avoid a repeat of this one. How should it do this? Well, by preventive maintenance instead of retroactively mending & quot;, he explained.
& quot; We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, but also we residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city government needs to change its strategy in order to keep the city in good condition. & quot;
& quot; There are other passages that also look unkempt and unfinished & quot;, he said, & quot; for example el Escudo y el Venadito de Mazatlán. & quot;
& quot; Today, we need more than advertising to attract tourists. We need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and tourist attractions constantly in good shape, 'he added.
& quot; These precautions have not received enough attention, and this type of incident exposes what is obvious to everyone: A maintenance is urgently needed. & quot;
Raúl Llera Martínez, Assistant Secretary of Promoción Turística, stressed the importance of saving the tourist sites of Mazatlán, because they were not being used properly and gave a bad impression.
He mentioned a number of places that need to be revamped together with the city. Making the city clean, orderly and attractive for tourism should be priority.
& quot; Fortunately, Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites that need to be cleaned up and cleaned up to make them attractive to tourists and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP Demands Results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chair of the CCE, suggested that MEPs should take the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The business community of Mazatlán demands a dignified parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces big problems.
Yesterday, the 60th National Assembly was inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN MPs, three Partido Nueva Alianza MPs, two PRD MPs, one PT MP, one Convergencia MP and one PVEM member.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel obliged to society and to the different social groups that depend on responsible work in parliament, and not repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE Entrepreneurship Coordination Council, suggested that the new members of parliament should take the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
& quot; We hope that MEPs really do exercise their right to act free of collusion between the parties, because it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, turning themselves into carnival extras of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups. & quot;
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the bridges necessary to support the current government.
& quot; We want to make sure that they do a trustworthy job and that they are above all responsible for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them during the last elections. & quot;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the great challenges facing the 40 elected representatives is the drive and the common work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
& quot; The most important thing is that they stimulate economic growth, stimulate investment and stimulate infrastructure, which in some way will stimulate job creation.
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary place in the state budget to promote it.
& quot; I understand that it is the ministry with the second least resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign currency and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry.
Money must be allocated to tourist projects, state security must be supported, and the Alcohol Law, which has not been reworded in previous legislatures, must be updated.
Looking for a Holy King
Children of the Coronado Valenzuela family yearn for dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
Parents will find it difficult to fulfil these wishes on Epiphany, because the household consists of no more than twelve people and one kid.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan, and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar will give them the toys and the clothes they so crave.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende housing estate. They live from hand to mouth, because their father has no steady job.
& quot; Sometimes it's hard because my husband has no job. But we sell tangerines and potatoes... Even in the afternoon, I go out with the brats to sell. & quot; said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four year old Adelaida wants a doll or a bicycle, while her three year old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten year old José Alfredo wants to have a & apos; monster cart & apos; and for his eight month old brother Jesús Cayetana proposes clothes the size of a horse for one year old.
& quot; (José Alfredo) told me, & apos; I so much like this monster & apos;, but I replied to him, & apos; let's wait and see, boy & apos;, because it was very expensive & quot;, Cayetana remembered sadly.
Clothing and shoes would be ideal for the older children who were in school.
Eleven-year-old Maria Guadalupe is a size 12; Isaías, aged ten, is a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
The 14 year old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair of size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the campaign & apos; Holy King will be looked for & apos; by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday about ten houses were searched in the administrative region of Estrie as part of the destruction of a cannabis production and distribution network.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, locations which are said to have mainly been used for the production of drugs.
About 750 cannabis plants, four kilograms of hashish, cash and equipment used in the production of cannabis have been confiscated, Quebec police spokesman Louis-Philippe Ruel said.
A total of eleven men and three women have been arrested, two of whom are believed to be the main perpetrators of the drug ring, from Sherbrooke.
The arrested people are said to have appeared outside the Courthouse in Sherbrooke just hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with the production of cannabis, its possession for sale, conspiracy, and the service of crime.
The searches were the result of a lengthy investigation lasting more than a year.
'The information we received from the public authorities enabled us to make these arrests,' Ruel explained.
Around 70 officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit, the Quebec Security Unit, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Home Immigration Could Be Easily Tracked
The Conservative bill, which the government says will address the problem of boats loaded with secret migrants, is expected to be scrapped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday they could not support the proposal.
& quot; I am firmly opposed to this Charter. & quot;
& quot; I am standing with a party that has put you in a corner & quot; declared Michael Ignatieff, Leader of the Liberals, to the assembled delegates after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argued that the proposed law, which allows anyone to be detained for up to one year by a seaplane identified as being used to transport illegal immigrants, violates Canada's constitution on human rights and liberty.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it was targeting the wrong target group.
& quot; We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government does', declared M. Duceppe.
Criticism over immigration by Olivia Chow, NDP, has brushed off critics who insist that her party is not steadfast enough in its attitude to illegal immigrants.
& quot; The neo-Democrats agree to take action on stowaway passengers, and that is what we are trying to do by brokering another bill, the C-35, "Chow said.
We are not in favor of the conservative bill because it blames the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least one year, 'Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of toying with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
& quot; Canadians strongly tell MEPs that they do n 't tolerate this type of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country like a doorman. & quot;
& quot; You expect Canada to take tough action & quot; this is Minister Kennedy's reaction.
& quot; The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law, which could have led the country to elections that the government rejected.
However, one Conservative MP has told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
New Unit Could Not Find Unity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the possible formation of a new standing anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public inquiry committee on the subject.
Robert Dutil, the Minister of Public Security, maintains that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this topic last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than just one person.
It has to be said that this measure was not discussed in the least, despite the presence of Robert Dutil, at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
Nor was it a fluke that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, described this announcement as a public-safety & quot; rabbit & quot; and a & quot; solution crafted at the end of the table.
Minister Dutil, in turn, addressed those who fear that political power has too much influence over the future unity in question.
& quot; You will see the result when we announce it & quot;, he was content to affirm.
& quot; Man is aware of this problem. & quot;
Nothing can replace conducting a public survey, according to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ.
& quot; The more M. Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I will think that he has something to hide, 'he explained.
& quot; The only way to form an investigative committee is to resign from Jean Charest & quot;, said Yves Boisvert, Lecturer in Ethics and Policy Systems at the ENA (National College of Senior Administrative Training).
In order to break the deadlock, he proposes that Quebec give auditors a special mandate to investigate corruption and collusion.
& quot; One should be able to extend the mandate of the audit control & quot;, so he decided.
He also argues that Quebec could give audit control the same power as commissioners, allowing it to oblige people to testify.
Formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the Charest government's drawers.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend its penal code to better reflect this type of crime.
This request came from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of criminal prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which dealt with motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested, although the penal code had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism as a result.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several streams remain under heavy guard due to heavy rainfall that has been falling in some areas of the province since Tuesday.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauricie county, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudiere.
A road collapsed in the process.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain of 40 to 70 milliliters of rain fell on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 additional millimeters of rain were expected here, depending on the regions, until Thursday evening.
Areas north of the river and the Outaouais valley were worst affected.
There had been a total of up to 100 millimetres of rain here.
As snowmelt, which has already accumulated in certain areas, is added to these rainfall, it is feared that several streams will cross.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Police Department issued flood alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers to the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and in the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood control and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an emergency bridge was pulled away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the community of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on high alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Security Adviser Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec National Flood Center issued warnings Wednesday for large increases in several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont reprimanded in part
Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before Canada's Board of Radio Standards (CCNR) for his controversial comments on social welfare and Haitians, as well as his lewd talk on radio.
The CCNR maintains that while Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinions, certain statements made by & quot; included inaccurate information about social welfare, unwarranted negative portrayals of Haitians, and even crude language that is inappropriate for daytime programming.
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion on suicide, which involves publishing the names of two persons who have committed suicide, violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts of 2008 and 2010.
The first order was lodged following a complaint by the & quot; Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec & quot;.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts quoted in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide solid information rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont said that suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the members of the Supervisory Board concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to a life crisis.
& quot; The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the contested consequences of the show & quot; Dupont le midi & quot; would have brought up a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and appropriate manner.
As a result, he has not been censured at all.
The last point of contention was the statements referring to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had engaged in a media dispute about this, which elicited a lot of reactions.
The CHOI host had declared that he had not donated to help Haiti, because he did not know for sure if the people in need would actually receive the money.
The Board of Supervisors considers that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect is an unjustified negative portrayal of the Haitians.
& quot; I have already served my three-day suspension sentence in this case. & quot;
& quot; My file has been virgin & quot; for a year and a half, 'explained the moderator.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of crude language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio announcer & quot; acted beyond his obligations & quot;.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was supposed to have reported its decisions once during prime time, within a period of three days, are negligible.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal-Algerian origin, has chosen a very special path.
The athlete, who excels in & quot; Sanda & quot; (Full Contact Kung-Fu), Kickboxing and Thai Boxing, is now climbing the tatami and boxing rings of the world in his search for new challenges.
& quot; I started martial arts in Algeria 12 years ago, doing kung-fu and kickboxing, 'explained Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 in order to develop himself among the pros.
Personally, I like fighting everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fighting as presented by mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.
Recently, the security worker, who works for UPS, gave bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 23-30 October.
& quot; I won the Full Contact Kickboxing and Thai classes & quot;, 'he explained.
& quot; Currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China. & quot;
& quot; Invited fighters from each category who finished in the top four at the last World Championships.
& quot; I took bronze in Toronto 2009. & quot;
& quot; 2005 I finished 8th in Vietnam. & quot;
& quot; 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while 2009 in Toronto, I finished third & quot;, "he added.
& quot; It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in each competition. & quot;
& quot; With this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year! & quot;
& quot; San Shou & quot; or & quot; Sanda & quot; are Chinese-origin disciplines where punches and kicks are allowed, as well as floor throws.
The duels are usually held on a platform, but rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer to emerge from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well-known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal keeps only one event in his career, he would definitely call his presence at the Super Tournament & quot; King of Sanda & quot;, the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
& quot; This match is the highest ranking and the most respected & quot; match in China, declared the likable Pfundskerl.
& quot; It's a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee (Thailand' s largest stadium).
& quot; That was a great experience. & quot;
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
& quot; The guy who defeated me was a real professional & quot;, so he analyzed.
& quot; There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).
& quot; The semi-final winners meet in the final of their category. & quot;
& quot; Then the winners of each category go head-to-head to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu. & quot;
450 million in non-competitive contracts
Hydro-Québec has approved, by mutual consent, $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project to project developers.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor received the most important share, namely the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;, was formed in 2004 as a concomitant to Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the & quot; Consortium & quot; Énergie gérance & quot; won the lucrative contract without having put it out to tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to business consortia poses a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of competition displacement and price increase.
& quot; This is a new way of playing a concocted game and weakens the competition. & quot;
& quot; This means that instead of playing games as a conspiracy, it is now playing them in an open manner, rather than in a secret manner, explained Sylvain Simard, PQ deputy, at the press conference yesterday.
Early in the morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because he finds it difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had reacted to this in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a collusion.
& quot; I remain true to & quot;,'she railed, asserting that the PQ' s conduct was dishonest & quot; and that & quot; lacks toughness & quot;.
She said that the least that could be done was for the PQ to apologize.
The model of the consortium is world-wide common practice.
This is usually a temporary alliance allowing two or more companies to pool their expertise in making a bid for a complex project.
The & quot; project Eastmain & quot; has a high level of complexity in terms of its amount of work.
Construction is underway and should be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any possibility of competition; there had already been negotiations.
Moreover, the consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As & quot; Le Devoir & quot; noted last week, the consortium's model of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief flyover of the Quebec Register of Companies allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which appear to be of durable duration.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, such as CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, goes back to the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the & quot; consortium Énergie gérance & quot;, Minister Normandeau stressed that & quot; has a special dynamic of labour in the Baie James and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s.
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d & apos; énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), made a statement that blew his nose at the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
& quot; If you make a call for entries and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will skyrocket. & quot;
& quot; So you have two options: either you take the people who are in this market and say to yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price. & quot;
& quot; The idea is that it is not the price that counts, but the expertise of the people, 'Laporte reiterated.
This contract, granted to the & quot; Consortium & quot; Énergie & quot;, is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, & quot; Le Devoir & quot; counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had got 22 contracts, Génivar had got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their participation in & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;.
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the $295 131 564 contract with & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;.
Sylvain Simard had let it be known that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of & quot; Parti libéral du Québec were well known & quot;.
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally connected to the companies that financed & quot;, before clarifying that it was more about their executives.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The & quot; Green & quot; label is not trust-inspiring
Green, but bluntly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little trust in the main actors of sustainable growth, but nor in the labels or the eco-labels that are supposed to guide his choices.
What a pity, because it is bathed in a universe full of media, teeming with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption is beset by a lack of credible information, a lack of which is becoming apparent as a brake on its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading held yesterday.
Although they promoted the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebec people do not seem to give much credit to those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec's population admits to having no faith in companies' environmental activism as much as in green corporate advertising, according to the new measurement tool developed by the University of Quebec's Responsible Consumer Center.
Another finding: half of the consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates, which are attached to the allegedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves environmentally conscious, so the barometer.
In the same vein, only 14.6% of Quebec's population take seriously the discourse of politicians on the topic.
Information about responsible consumption seems important, however, in stimulating this segment of consumption, which is currently stimulated by nearly only one-third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer, after the higher price of the products.
Moreover, one-third of Quebec citizens are suspicious of the stated efficiency of the green products and services that they are trying to provide.
Another report indicates that by 2010 more than half of the consumers had already changed their habits, mainly changing the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, 61% of them preferred shopping at traders in their neighbourhood, favouring the purchase of food products grown in their region.
Green and responsible - the Environmental Consumption Index reached 64 this year, up from its maximum of 100 - Quebec's Homo consuus loves to present himself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce his environmental footprint by taking care of the welfare of animals.
However, social and environmental awareness appears to be holding back, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebec residents said they used public transportation or preferred the ride-sharing center in order to demonstrate their environmental interest.
Walking and cycling were also favoured by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds into stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned eXcentris cinema complex on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, to restore it to its proper cinematic function, apparently do not get what they asked for.
The government has accepted to become involved, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a loan of less than initially hoped for, which could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to sources quoted in the state rumor mill.
An initial action plan as well as a request for EUR 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring; the request has since been revised downwards.
A proposal accompanied by an action plan has already been sent by François Macerola, President of & quot; Société de développement des entreprises culturelles & quot; (SODEC), to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet's counter-proposal was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallele and Angus now have until December 31 to reply.
In any case, the premise of state donations really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let's remember that the Quebec community of cinema and cinema complex owners had rebelled against direct state investment in support of the eXcentris acquisition, arguing that the Minister of Education did not have financial support for real estate projects there that he had not given to other cinemas.
However, several other players in the market of the segment complained of substantial economic assistance.
Head of the cinema Daniel Langlois, after having built the cinema himself for over ten years, had difficulties presenting the auteur's cinema on the premises of his complex, which might justify the exceptional position of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas that show independent films is more than evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knows how to keep its clientele on side.
Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle headed by Christian Yaccarini, are heading for a privately financed campaign, from which they hope to raise a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen continues to show movies in eXcentris, Le Parallèle.
The aim of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with a screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois & quot; Des hommes et des dieux & quot;.
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not removed the newspaper & quot; Le Devoir & quot;, and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-adjusted proposals that have been made to them.
Mystery of Complex-Shaken Canada Uncovered
The new American diplomatic cables, leaked by WikiLeaks, shed light on what the United Nations considers to be the inferiority complex of Canadians vis-à-vis Americans, but at the same time expose Canada's sense of superiority.
Consequently, American diplomats are astonished that the Canadian electorate did not have Canadian-American relations in mind when voting, and they believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, published in public yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantive content to nibble on.
A liaison dated 22 September 2008, during the period when the federal campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations ceases to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
Much to the astonishment of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador to Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers several ways of explaining this situation.
& quot; An almost inferiority complex inherent in Canadians may be more likely to induce Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday internal issues, than to blame the United States in this election (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign), as & quot; is how he describes it.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus & quot; the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too menacing to speak of him & quot;.
The Ambassador does not understand this deafening silence any more than he does because the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
& quot; Logically, & quot;, he assesses, & quot; should be the ability of a candidate, of a party, and much more so of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship, which the voter has in mind as a key factor at the ballot box. & quot;
The other expression of this sense of importance is the message sent by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, on 22 January 2009, in preparation for President Barack Obama's first visit to Ottawa.
& quot; Your trip will help ensure the continuation of the government in the confidence vote on the federal budget at the beginning of February, at which Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, which originated from a stimulus program worth 30 to 40 billion dollars & quot;, describes Breese.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament being toppled by the coalition and the thus conditional persistence of the opposition parties being affected by the quality of the proposed stimulus program.
Another notice, dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, notifies Washington of the increasingly negative perception that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC are coming from the United States.
The Ambassador is disturbed by shows like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which there are few subtle references to Maher Arar, the & quot; No-Fly-List & quot; or even discharges for interrogations conducted by CIA muscle men.
Yet another communication details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was willing to accept certain Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes, but on the basis of an individual & quot; decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described, & quot; gave the Secretary of State a piece of paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15 year old Muslim of Canadian descent.
& quot; The Secretary of State has agreed to review the file.
Let's finally say that tempers are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a longtime aide to Stephen Harper, had declared on CBC that those responsible for the massive leak should be 'killed & quot;'.
He was referring here to Mike Huckabee of the United States.
Worldwide lighting renewal plan
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew lighting in homes, commerce and industry in 100 countries to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases (CFCs), which is almost one-third of the additional reduction that is required to stabilize the earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments by developed countries.
Under the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem, in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted into the earth from lighting, would be avoided if the incandescent white bulbs, which are still a monopoly of 50-70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent LEDs (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases in the global fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitters of greenhouse gases, including the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans aimed at reducing global CFC emissions from 53Gt to 49Gt.
However, we would have to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance in order to stabilise the climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius from now to 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the incandescent white bulbs, 95% of the energy is released in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% is used to produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%; with the new LED bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by a factor of two.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10.000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as the one launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - this company, incidentally, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, giving an indication of the savings potential of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs only emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury, and that they must therefore be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, unless the producers provide a collection point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent light bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plant, which emits much more mercury to generate the electricity generated by the incandescent light bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25.000 tonnes of mercury per annum.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion annually purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, which would cost Indonesia $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits election results announcement
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has requested the 'quot;' immediate publication of the results of the presidential election of Ivory Coast immediately after its deadline.
& quot; The Secretary General stresses the need of the Independent Election Commission to keep its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay, stressed a spokesman of the UN chief.
& quot; He asks all political parties and institutions of Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the preliminary results are announced.
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission missed the deadline of Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, without releasing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the European Commission confirmed on television that the Commission would continue working & quot; to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were numerous calls from around the world for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of voting, headed by the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the Constitutional Council to annul & quot; fraudulent votes in the north by the ex-rebel camp of Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N & apos; Guessan, Ivory Coast's head of the presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN' s tactics of intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if Gbagbo's complaints are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
The opponents of Gbagbo, however, are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, because it is headed by Paul Yao N & apos; Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man of the North, who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, described the delay in announcing the results of the elections as' unacceptable 'and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he did not go as far as to claim victory.
His allies insist that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, because he knows that he lost; and that it is illegal to file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results.
The second round of Sunday's presidential election was billed as the crowning glory of a country that has been divided into two parts for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast leaders on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of voting on 31 October with 38% of the vote, compared with 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of former president Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as the leading candidate.
Unemployment rate stable in France in third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% (9.7% for the overseas departments), according to the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, according to the preliminary seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office in Insee.
The metropolis' unemployment rate stood at 2.631 million.
The second quarter data represented 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the working population in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million of the French capital's 3.4 million employed were unemployed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, whether they were every other week working or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market continued to deteriorate, with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% involving the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, saw a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolitan area (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 people over the age of 50, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 pp over three months, + 0.1 pp over a year) and 8.8% in France in general.
After an argument about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee does not publish the monthly unemployment numbers anymore since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, however, continues in this methodology, announcing on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments), up from 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, a waste disposal manager and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), was investigated and sent to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of corporate assets, embezzlement of public property, theft, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and weapons possession, according to his lawyer.
& quot; Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and plans to speak out on all the questions the prosecution will ask him, rather than spite his face.
& quot; It is easy to subject him to a series of criminal charges, it is another thing to prove & quot;, 'his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) ahead of his client' s hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had insisted on sending the judge, through his lawyers, a memorandum of justification to justify himself before his hearing.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to Lucien Simon, his lawyer, his client had never done anything but keep running the landfill he had to manage.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the associated funds, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne agglomeration, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was then released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts.
& quot; My client was able to provide explanations of the facts accused him of. & quot;
& quot; The lead prosecutor has taken care not to deprive him of his liberty, said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from custody on Tuesday night, two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for unauthorised influence and passive bribery.
Two state officials from the Aubagne area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on charges of title 'quot; evasion and misappropriation of public property by a public official' quot; and the other on charges of complicity in embezzlement of public funds' quot;.
The partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of stealing and embezzlement of & quot; company assets.
Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar public-sector fraud scandal affecting Corsica, is among the individuals to be compared with Guérini.
Investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from high-level criminal circles.
The investigation into X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, especially in the waste branch, is being led in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
From sources close to the investigation, it appears that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions under which the contract was awarded and on the operation of a landfill at La Ciotat, which also receives waste from the Aubagne region, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: Elysée Palace exaggerates its role as intermediary for Syria
For more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for espionage, captivated the French public, alarmed diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper & quot; reveal some of the background to this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went as far as to give advice on how to deal with their own crisis of & quot; taking hostages of & quot; in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that freeing the young French woman was not in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian prisoner in France who was wanted by the American justice system for trafficking material in support of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they shine a bright light on the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media in order to convince them that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing of the sort.
A diplomatic telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 was titled & quot; Iran: French Commentaries on Hostage Taking.
François Richier, Elysée strategic adviser, met American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d 'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
The advised the Americans to do everything they could to return their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
& quot; Makes Noise & quot;, they said, & quot; articulates loud and clear and ceaselessly & quot; the words & quot; Fundamental Human Rights & quot; Innocence & quot;, & quot; Immediate Release & quot; in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
& quot; Do this all the more, since the Iranians ask you not to do it.
Because & quot; silence solves nothing & quot;, past the attempts at discussion on inconspicuous way, the Iranians are & quot; masters of evasion & quot;.
Mr Richier adds that arresting aliens is a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.
He announces that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (which was supposed to take place on August 16th, the day she took refuge in the French embassy)'s will demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians' (230.000 Euro deposit).
And he announces that the Elysée is anticipating more kidnappings, a phenomenon that & quot; will worsen.
Iranians could 'quot; arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran in the near future,' he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but she remains detained in Iran.
Information has been circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whom the United States is asking to be extradited to Iran for illegally trafficking sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison after a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, questions this disturbing coincidence.
Releasing Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is tracking Iran's illegal networks of acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted horse-trading?
Liberating the Iranian for the French?
On September 4th, François Richier renews his conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, assuring him that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only taken aback by the decision of the judge, but tried to protest against it.
& quot; There has been a lively exchange between the French presidency and the French minister of justice (currently Michele Alliot-Marie), but the French government cannot change the decision of the judge, 'quot;', he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the strict & quot; supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a telephone number, hangs up, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the buildings managed by the Iranian Embassy in Paris' quot;.
During Clotilde Reiss' custody in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts, through pronouncements and media-organized escape attempts, to make people believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is playing a & quot; important & quot; and & quot; influential role of mediator.
Americans observe this activity not without irony, observing that the manipulation bears fruit, because several press articles mirror the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 invokes & quot; the media blitz of the French authorities.
What is the basis for so much & quot; of thanksgiving & quot; to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
& quot; Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elysée has succumbed to this fiction.
Intensive communication & quot; aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria, analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which was perceived as premature and undeserved by many critics in France and abroad.
& quot; Building the role of Syria & quot; Paris & quot; tries to demonstrate to Syria what reward can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region.
The aim is also to sow & quot; discord between Syria and Iran.
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier confided to her: & quot; of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything.
& quot; But we still thanked them. & quot;
& quot; This should at least create confusion for the Iranians
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16th, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their active role in securing the release of our fellow countryman.
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called & quot; The Cinderella & quot;, which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have indicated.
A bill to require online gaming operators to deny access to games to minors under 16 after midnight will go to parliament in December, representatives from education and family ministries said.
& quot; Many children play these games all night long and then struggle with learning at school and also with living a normal life during the day. & quot;
& quot; We believe that this law is necessary to protect their health and their right to sleep, "Jo Rin, the ministerial officer responsible for this draft law, told Agence France Presse.
The online games will be accessible again from 6 a.m. onwards.
Manufacturing companies will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to lower the daily time limit for accessing these games for those youngsters whose parents request it, the official added.
It will also provide free programs that allow people to limit the amount of time they spend on the Internet, if they so wish.
South Korea is one of the most & quot; connected & quot; countries, and newspapers regularly report various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in worldwide online gaming competitions.
By November, South Korea had won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, out of 58 nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoint host country
In a flurry of excitement stemming from suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday appointed the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the scramble for influence and lobbying threaten to eclipse the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of the supreme FIFA discipline will be held in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Union hopes to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its presence in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the head of government of Belgium and Holland, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) defines the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes threaten to continue until the last minute.
Difficult, if not, to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the forefront of the revelations by orchestrating the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), might as well have ruined the chances of their own country, the cradle of football, hosting only one World Cup, in 1966.
The BBC had reignited this debate on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that blasted three influential committee members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is reason enough to anger FIFA and to embarrass the English officials, who in the first instance lobbied David Cameron intensively in these last few weeks.
The PM is hoping to replicate the success of his predecessor Tony Blair, who managed to organise the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Would that amount of effort be enough to restore England's image to the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the economic and financial downsides of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the outright insinuation that the English press is accusing the committee members of an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote.
& quot; You throw dirt on them, you try to compromise them & quot; railed Putin.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorite.
First World Economic Power, home to the main FIFA sponsors, the country appears to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, who separately have put together a very nice project.
But these new candidacies appear premature for two countries that co-organized the 2002 tournament.
Another threat: China's eagerness to host the 2026 World Cup, with FIFA denying Asian chances of hosting it in 2022.
With Australia and Qatar pulling out all the stops to stage futuristic stadiums, FIFA are pursuing the expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the perceived weakness of television rights (due to the time difference), FIFA's touchy-feely nerve.
Second mandate: overt
De Gaulle had really trimmed.
Mitterrand had given the impression that he was in a state of shock.
Valéry Giscard d 'apos; Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysée conjures up the next.
The current leader will be ergo the candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not sit well with the side of the mystery inherent in the functioning of the presidency.
So we have to pretend that there is no longer any doubt.
In one sense as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without their own belief.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured Sarkozy in a serious tone that he would make his decision'some time in the autumn of 2011'.
That he would raise the prospect of "quot; two mandates" in front of UMP MPs in the Elysée on Tuesday evening had given a sense of febrile.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely reiterated that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election in a humorous tone at such meetings.
& quot; at best you have seven-and-a-half years left with me, or at best & quot;, 'he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: & quot; Do n 't think that I' t think about the phase after that. & quot;
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but no less.
If they provoke comments, they do so for two reasons.
Acceleration of the race to become a candidate with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of competition with Ségolène Royal that prompts Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012 that prompts many PS members to declare war earlier than anticipated.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy by François Fillon over that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to the BVA-L & apos; Express poll).
& quot; We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it & quot; reacted promptly and cautiously the environment of the Prime Minister.
& quot; If he thinks defeat is possible, he would not be a candidate. & quot; informs Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
& quot; He will always believe he can win & quot; corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned himself to the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB's Governing Council last year was supposed to be an opportunity to show how to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the formation of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European sovereign debt obliges, the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot afford to forfeit today's more than tense situation on the European bond markets, lest it cause its deterioration.
The political cost of doing so would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed at a press conference yesterday the active role played by the ECB in solving Europe's sovereign debt.
It has not dared to say whether it believes that the Central Bank could do more, for example by relaunching its programme of buying government bonds.
& quot; I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) & quot;
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, was not very eloquent about his intentions at the hearing of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in Brussels the day before, but was content to point out that the programme of government bond-buying was continuing in the secondary market and that we' ll see what the decisions were going to be at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB doubled the treasury's bond purchases last week, to approximately €1.35 billion.
And, according to leaks from some traders, yesterday it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
In total, the central banks of the Euro system have made purchases amounting to 67 billion euro since May 2010.
Anticipating the purchase price is in no way disputed among traders (see page 29).
Economists do not expect a significant change in course any more.
When the ECB's bond transactions of more than three months have disappeared from the ECB' s arsenal, the ECB's unrestricted cash reserves will be freely mobilised over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already expecting this measure to extend for a few more months.
& quot; I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme substantially.
& quot; Otherwise, it risks provoking new tensions in the short term, surmises Michael Schubert, Economist at Commerzbank.
& quot; A gradual exit in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely, & quot; anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of intervention on the & quot; sovereign debt market, the ECB should maintain the volume of bonds bought that stimulates the sluggish market, adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposure of European banks to the sovereign debt markets of the eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
& quot; must step up at all costs to compensate the deficient investors in the market and act in this way to prevent rash enthusiasm about the yields paid to the weakest states, a major bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates soar, governments will be even more prevented from reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, things eased a little yesterday, with the fall in core interest rates to 10-year levels.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, Regional President Giulio Tremonti described the situation as' indecipherable 'and told him to expect' an unpredictable weekend ', which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, however, the gap between German interest rates reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts covering the risk of bankruptcy rose to 263 points, causing some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to the Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with Germany' s interest rate is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, was very worried about the market turbulence and a possible contagion coming from Ireland.
& quot; The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland. & quot;
& quot; The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal, explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain English, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dwindling tax revenues, which put the state in danger of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the Government.
In the future, Italy's growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget under scrutiny by the Senate projects 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the budget deficit next year will amount to 4.3% of GDP (against the government's forecast of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar over a new budgetary collective that could be deployed after the holidays to the tune of EUR 7 billion.
& quot; New austerity measures must be implemented if necessary & quot; says chartered accountant Olli Rehn
For now, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
& quot; The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are in order, we have been repeating this for a long time now & quot; assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is in charge of Italy at the IMF.
& quot; There are no problems right now, in the short term or in the long term, because despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. R.), Italy is required to make less progress towards stabilization than other countries, observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
What remains is the question of political instability.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the lower house of parliament, which could lead to early elections as early as the end of March.
There is therefore a rather unfavourable period ahead for decision-making on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about strengthening anti-crisis measures
As Christine Lagarde had emphasised explicitly yesterday at a press conference in Paris: 'Quot; I think we proved it again on Sunday afternoon and in the evening: Europeans clearly stick together, they are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area'.
Although perfectly relative, yesterday's fall in the interest rates on European government bonds was bad news for governments and the ECB.
There is no sign yet of a normalization start.
The rating agency Standard & amp; Poor & apos; had announced that it could downgrade the debt rating of Portugal, arguably the most effective target for speculators today.
& quot; As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political awareness, especially in banking systems, argues the economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since & quot; is a political time that passes much more slowly than that of the markets.
The European countries, which are well aware of both the gulf and the danger that it poses, are intensifying the discussions on strengthening the anti-crisis measures that already exist.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly affected, and more broadly with their counterparts at the G20, are progressing well.
And we will do so in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan is for the unconventional measures to strengthen the support of the countries of the eurozone to be used in the markets' crosshairs (see below).
As regards the EU's stability funds, their Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore, to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If his visit is not specifically about fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
The first expenditure of paper from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States supports a possible increase in the funds mobilized by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the front line, are preparing to undertake structural reforms, in particular in the area of the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms to be added to the austerity, but expected to have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path to that pursued by Greece and Ireland.
Both sides must avoid having to ask for international assistance at all costs, before they have established their own budgetary adjustments and decided on unavoidable structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the sovereign debt markets.
Axel Weber, who was in transit in Paris on 24 November, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to dig deep again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is a major player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be enough, 'preferably in the form of a direct liquidity injection'.
This tool exists: the European mechanism of financial stabilization, which currently amounts to EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being scrutinised closely in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions deteriorate.
Snow and black ice: 24 Departments on orange alert
The snow episodes are still causing traffic problems, especially on Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and black ice.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne regions have been added to the 20 departments already on orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two since Wednesday afternoon, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, heavy snow showers affect northern Gironde as well as the Charentes, snowing slightly on et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow blankets of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm are expected, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The affected regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d 'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is substantial enough to cause traffic disruption and disrupt certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the region of Côtes d 'apos; Armor, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation on Brittany's secondary transport networks is very difficult according to traffic police, who advise against using your vehicle only in case of an emergency, and the use of some TER buses was cancelled for the whole day.
In Picardy, school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy goods vehicles on Wednesday evening.
The Prefecture of & quot; urges drivers to take extreme care on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly.
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of flights departing from Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to expected heavy snowfall.
DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London, as well as Edinburgh Airport in Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial outlines
Billions have been rained off since the debate on modernising the transport economy on the Ile-de-France was in full swing.
At least in the discussions.
Consider in particular the $23 billion to be built by the Société du Grand Paris for the Metro Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of SGP, the state declared a capital allotment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then enable SGP to lend a part of the sum in the markets at twice the amount.
Today, the first projections finally came about.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the National Assembly Finance Committee, contains the foreseen measures to raise the first part of these funds.
There are two types of measures: the creation of a special tax on development and higher taxation of Ile-de-France's offices.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes' quot; 'in favour of the Société du Grand Paris & quot; public institution.
This is a figure: & quot; The product of this tax is 117 million euro per year & quot;.
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate tax: & quot; to modernize it, to increase the product derived from it and to transfer this increase to & quot; the Société du Grand Paris.
How much would this bring in?
A puzzle.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
You are far away from the 4 billion.
& quot; It is stated that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital raised by the state and gradually contributed to the project by the Société du Grand Paris, as explained in the explanatory statement.
In SGP, you do not find this system offensive at all.
& quot; From the moment you enter the receipts (the two taxes, that is, the general rule), you can cover the project for more than three years, and then draw only from the $4 billion of revenue & quot;, as explained.
& quot; This is noted in the budget and gradually subtracted.
SGP estimates that in 2013 it will start recording the $4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the 4 billion promised by many years to come, runs the risk of provoking quite an animated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will take place on December 7th.
Vengeful Hackers and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a dual meaning.
On one hand, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at an international level, and gives a foretaste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The & quot; extraordinary & quot; American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw off nothing more than what was published in any magazine for months anyway (except the one Berlusconi owns), and Gadhafi' s horrifyingly caricatured profile has long been the stuff of cabaret artists' sketches.
The rule that the secret files can only consist of news that has already been known is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to Esoteric publications, you will see that each work (The Grail, The Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, The Templars, or The Rosary) repeats exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not simply because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who are dedicated to occult believe in nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Likewise the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited in spirit) is also the chief of the secret service (otherwise he might be some other guy, like an editor at Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi sent by the American Embassy in Rome to the State Department was the same as the information Newsweek had published the week before.
So why has there been such a fuss about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one page, they state what every educated person already knows: that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II, and since then also when the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small tasks of representation, have turned into spy centers.
Any investigative viewer knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy to pretend to ignore it.
Nevertheless, the fact that it is repeated in public violates the mission of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-factor hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
What is more, the scandal brings about distress not so much for the victims but for the & quot; executioners.
But let's focus on the profound nature of what has happened.
In the days of Orwell, all power could be concentrated like Big Brother, controlling every gesture made by his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have proved perfectly correct, since then, when you could control every movement, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway chosen, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
If, however, one considers what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can discover the secrets of power.
How can a power hold out when it is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
True, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free from secrets, because it exposes the public sphere; but to reveal, in the style of WikiLeaks, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to deprive her of any power.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will be the consequences of this insult done to such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future States will not put any kind of reserved information online - that would be like putting a notice board on a street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies it is futile to hope to be able to keep confidential reports over telephone.
Nothing is easier than figuring out if and when a Head of State travels on a plane and contacts one of his colleagues.
How could private and only for certain ears be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romanticism, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, secretly moving assiduously along uncontrollable paths, carrying their communications nowhere else but in my memory, and moreover, hiding the little written information they received in their shoe sale.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the espionage attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is advancing like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) videotape enabled film researchers to explore a film tape-by-tape, allowing one to rewind from back to back and unravel all the secrets of the montage, while nowadays (numerical) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, in macro portions.
The high-speed train takes three hours to get from Rome to Milan, while it takes three and a half hours to get there by plane, including a transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to revert to cars and horses.
One last observation.
In former times, the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies requesting sensitive information from the press.
Climate: how France whitewashes its fiscal promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine the fulfilment of rapidly dissolved financing promises (also called & quot; Fast Start & quot; or early financing) realized by developing countries.
And here are the rough French rhapsodies.
In the Copenhagen Accord, developing countries committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million euros per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start financing: a detailed report of actions taken by their Member States, press conferences, major side events, the distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and highly prized for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all the developed countries doing the same at the same precision level.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to pay respect to its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the details, things are a bit more complicated.
This money should, according to the Copenhagen Treaty, be new and additional, in order to ensure that an additional commitment is made without affecting ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what & quot; means new and additionally what & quot; means.
While the European Commission proposed harmonization, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone selects the benchmark they consider to be the best.
The European Commission has chosen, for example, the benchmark for 2009: international financing will be retained and 150 million will be added over three years under the & quot; Fast-Start & quot; financing scheme.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of ODA.
In return, France considered that the financing of all new projects & quot; of 2010 was new and additionally quot;.
In other words, there are no benchmark levels of spending for the preceding year, or for ODA at global level.
Specifically, the total amount of French support to developing countries may remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to be honouring its commitment to provide new and additional funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses his calculation mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 borrowed €as the equivalent of 1 donated €.
Obviously, it is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If loans for specific profitable investments (often carbon-mitigation projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceitful to present the Euro collected as the equivalent of a donated Euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan for the donor country should be counted as the commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind but the following consideration: respecting & quot; its commitment of 420 million by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to see for yourself.
France is the only EU country to use loans on a large scale.
Germany charges 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) pay 100% of their obligations through donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France gives just 10 cents, which is a comparable amount of money.
Beautiful hocus-pocus!
Overall, France is operating with a double fraud in its Fast-Start financing: on the one hand, the action is evolving over time, and on the other hand, the reality of the financial commitment.
France succeeds in giving the impression that it has spent 420 million euros of new and additional money in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
Manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who did the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once intra-EU (why do the other member states continue to donate, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question in relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions about the climate.
But it might be one drop too many in the UNFCCC's immense machinery.
Let's hope that does not happen.
Be that as it may, it is imperative to learn the lessons of this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and of compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could move forward with discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another crucial and currently debated topic): it cannot escape the question of & quot; accountability or the accounting nature of its loans.
France might change its position to be as progressive on the issues as it is on other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, arriving in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's Fast-Start and its vision of & quot; accountability and loan usage would by its very nature raise the international confidence base necessary for further discussion.
Alarm - Pesticides ingested by children
A child of 10 years of age consumes 81 different chemical substances over the course of the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Génération Futures (Former Movement for the Protection of the Rights and the Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which declares that the & quot; results do n 't reflect a statistically significant value because of the small number of samples analysed, but rather represent the illustrative character of the problem discussed. & quot; purchased the food usually consumed with meals by a child of about ten, plus a snack, from supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five pieces of fresh fruit and fruit, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water a day - were studied, as well as nibbles from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
The balance of plates is staggering: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic, 5 classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disrupting factor, according to studies of several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
& quot; Even if in approximately the entirety of cases the legal limits are not exceeded for each chemical, individually consumed substance, it is well inferred from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is potentially exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrinine disturbing factor is worrying.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues, three of the safely proven carcinogenic residues, as well as more than twenty residues which can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended for use as a snack in the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide which is banned in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
There were also minced meat, tuna from the can, even baguette and chewing gum laced with pesticides and other chemicals.
