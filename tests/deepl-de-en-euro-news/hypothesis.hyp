What to do, ČSSD? Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor does & quot; Confectionery & quot;.
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD ranks will obviously have to overcome some linguistic barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague City Council and in the city council at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně. cz has knocked members of the new council from the ČSSD a little bit of & quot;, as they master the notorious slang that has become naturalized in the last few years, when the current coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Prague's political elite in the past era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the city' s best known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it emerged that the new councils are being kept somewhat in the dark about these new terms.
Or at least they say they do.
& quot; Who Is Voldemort? & quot;
& quot; No clue. & quot;
& quot; I am rather a newcomer to Prague politics & quot;, Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, reacted to the test of & quot; Godfather's vocabulary & quot;.
But Councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, to the term & quot; golf floch & quot;.
& quot; This is the only expression that you put forward to me here, which I use occasionally. & quot;
& quot; Otherwise, I don 't like slang much. & quot;
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně. cz in June this year, before the ODS Electoral Congress, the editors picked six terms, mainly those notoriously associated with the Prague Municipal Council.
The Social Democrats should define the terms & quot; Voldemort & quot;, & quot; Prague's largest golfloch & quot;, & quot; go to the pastry shop & quot;, & quot; bull' neck & quot;, & quot; Betrayal of the Capital & quot; and & quot; bleach & quot;.
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, while the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of Prague's school system - initially promised to participate in the discussion, but did not even give the hearing aid.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, refused to sit the test at the outset.
& quot; I don 't care about these things, and how the Civil Democrats talk to each other, I don' t judge. & quot;
& quot; What is important to me is how we understand each other in the context of our programs & quot;, 'he countered.
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký allegedly did not recognize in the aforementioned headline that there was talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-Mayor Bém. Roman Janoušek.
The term & quot; Voldemort & quot; says absolutely nothing to Kaucky and the only word he correctly guessed at the test was & quot; the largest Prague golf hole & quot;.
& quot; This is the tunnel Blanka & quot;, says Kaucký, but added for security: & quot; But I know that more from the newspapers. & quot;
And jokingly: & quot; I will have to take a language course. & quot;
The & quot; golf hole & quot; is then correctly deciphered as Tunnel Blanka not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by Environment Councillor Lukáš Plachý.
However, both Social Democrats also know who Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even guesses where this character is to be found, and thereby also knows what it means to & quot; go to the & pastry shop & quot;.
& quot; I think that means going to some Prague catering establishment & quot;, Plachý is pretty close to solving the puzzle, if one knows that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserts that he learned this knowledge only from the newspaper, rather than from his own vocabulary.
Judging by the test participants, there does not seem to be a similar naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
& quot; I asked my colleagues too, but obviously there is no such thing here. & quot;
& quot; We call each other by name, sometimes we use abbreviations or nicknames & quot;, says Prague ČSSD Chairman Petr Hulínský - nicknamed Hulda & quot; by his party colleagues.
& quot; At school, I was called Bříza (Birch), but I do not know if my colleagues call me so & quot;, Karel Březina reveals his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně. cz tried out the name and see - it worked.
Councilor Weinert is friendly to the party members, the & quot; grandfather & quot; or less friendly to the & quot; old & quot; representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention before the elections through machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues, the & quot; Igráček & quot; (well-known Czech Lego figure).
Thus, nicknames are the only thing that the Social Democrats allow to be used in intra-party parlance.
Hulín allegedly does not like being called & quot; Hulda & quot;, but Deník Aktuálně. cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague Chairman.
His nickname & quot; Doctor of rubber truncheon rights & quot; is said to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský obtained his title Doctor juris at Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of 'quot; witches' and has published a pamphlet
Women who are labelled witches in Burkina Faso generally share some common characteristics in society.
They are more of the older generation, they cannot find a job - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women becomes the witch & quot;, she is strictly isolated, so that she can 't become dangerous to the rest of the village.
& quot; males are rarely affected by this fate. & quot;
& quot; This is also spared for young and healthy women, who help to work and bear children. & quot; describes the situation of more than one hundred women who have been abandoned by their communities in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, in a special home for women of color.
The local government decided to take action against this abnormal & quot; social measure & quot;.
And for this reason, it published a pamphlet aimed at stopping the persecution of & quot; witches.
There is a catch, however.
& quot; More than 70% of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read & quot; pointed out the dilemma of written enlightenment to the newspaper & quot; of the Standard & quot;.
But being accused of witchcraft is common practice in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27 year old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men who doused her in kerosene and simply set her alight.
This incident was reported by the BBC.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the incident was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to her version, oil was alight, which was used for ritual anointing.
This happened after the group tried to drive & quot; an evil ghost & quot; out of the woman & quot;.
The isolation of & quot; witches & quot; is supported by the people here, regardless of their education.
& quot; The Standard & quot; quoted a 42 year old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: & quot; eaters of human souls are a danger & quot;, as before.
While the Burkina Faso government is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian president gave the President himself a big helping hand.
& quot; President Yahya Jammeh launched a monstrous witch hunt after his aunt's death, claiming that she was complicit in her aunt' s death and that she would try to kill the President herself by black magic. & quot;
& quot; To this end, he called upon the help of shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by police officers, soldiers, and the President's bodyguard, kidnapped women and men at random from Gambia' s villages and forcibly took them to the President's Farm in Kanilai', the organization Amnesty International cited in its report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink a decoction made from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but it also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive their stay at the farm.
Only because of international pressure were the nearly thousand prisoners released again.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven, but pays higher rent
An elderly stocky man is leaving the client centre of RPG Byty des & quot; coal barons & quot; Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm is a folder containing three new leases for three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just had their rent increased in the context of the so-called & quot; deregulation.
Instead of 3500 kronor monthly rent, the son is to fork out 4100 kronor next year for a two-bedroom apartment with a second-class kitchen.
& quot; And there is not even hot running water in the flat, and you have to heat in a simple coal stove & quot;, 'he angrily taps his finger at his son' s new lease of life, to which he has a power of attorney to sign.
& quot; But what - I signed & quot;, "he explains half-upset and half-resigned.
The BytyOKD. cz civic association, which called the new terms & quot; incorrect and immoral & quot;, advises tenants not to sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7, when it plans to publish a guide on how to fight such contracts.
But the man just waves off.
& quot; One says this, the other the & quot;, he makes a sinister face.
The region of Ostrava will thus become the great & quot; deregulation laboratory & quot;.
After New Year, this deregulation will apply to most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market rent.
Aktuálně. cz therefore decided to visit this & quot; lab in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region, and it is already packed at 9am this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency, with a caller next to them.
& quot; Rent 2011 & quot; will show a special touch panel on the touchscreen.
Tap a button and the device spits out a number sheet.
We have barely deciphered the number & quot; 157 & quot; and it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it is your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room does not seem to be for the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance stuff and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will be flapping in the post boxes of most tenants of the 44,000 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes in the letters a rent increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for new rentals in the Client Centre has been open since 18th November.
& quot; The action runs a little over a week, that is, this is only the beginning of & quot;, the ladies behind the counter answer hesitantly after a moment, when the & quot; client turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' flats are a hot topic.
Prior to the elections, the ČSSD's Vice President of Parliament Lubomír Zaorálek, originally from Ostrava, had raised this issue rather loudly, so it is no wonder that today' s newspapers are full of them.
& quot; Twenty years I want a new floor from them. & quot;
& quot; Not even some damn toilet-goggles they could change & quot;, the aforementioned man fumbles.
Until now, according to staff, it has mainly been pensioners who have been waiting at the counter to see if they have actually received the promised reduction in rents that RPG will give them if they sign up for the special offer on time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by December 15 should also benefit from a half-price reduction.
So far, & quot; deregulation counter & quot; in Havířov is anything but overloaded with requests.
& quot; Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 were here for the 2011 rent, estimate the counter staff.
RPG offers individual rental agreements, where necessary, on its websites as well as blackboards.
However, if the leaseholders do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent tribunal.
& quot; This is not meant to be a threat, but to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal course of action, & quot; explains RPG on its web pages.
& quot; Nobody is going to court here. & quot; says one of the employees of RPG Byty, and a man on the street in front of the client center proves her at least partially right.
& quot; I have 13,000 (kronor) pension, with 5,000 left over for food, where should I get the money for a lawsuit & quot;, he says.
Then the employee becomes insecure.
& quot; Let's see. & quot;
& quot; Mr. Zaorálek tells them, through the media, not to sign, so people are still waiting for & quot; to give them pause.
Regulated rent in most of the Czech Republic will end on New Year '2011, and according to RPG Byty, "Rent increase is an economic necessity."
& quot; The existing amount of rent is not enough even to maintain the housing fund, argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of RPG Byty. - The neglect of the housing fund, which has been criticized by angry tenants, is according to the landlords' opinion the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion dollars in housing from the rents it collected between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to invest 5.2 billion dollars in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room of Havířov, some glowing red information appears from time to time.
& quot; Rent increases of 15% or less in 2011 affected 31,200 homes, more than 90% of RPG's homes. & quot;
& quot; Always means maximum CZK 7.50 per square meter per month & quot;, reads the LCD monitor.
Only for 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio, the rent increases by 38 percent.
& quot; These cases are about raising extremely low rental rates of 19.66 CZK per square meter & quot;, argues RPG.
For 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will take place step-by-step over four to eight years, not a sudden rise in rents.
What's more - the company has another obligation: The company wants to re-invest all the income from the rent increase (see chart) into flats, mainly in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - prioritize those people who sign agreements to increase rents.
The architects saw - a kindergarten is part of the office
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been open to Arch. Design staff since last year.
From the very beginning, the design and architecture firm Arch.Design, whose studios have provided a number of well-known Brno buildings, counted on the premises for its company mini-kindergarten from the very first designs for the new building Avriopoint.
Wisely, because most of its 90 employees are baby boomers, and the company is keen to get the project developers back to work as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility to work shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This will make it easier for civil engineers and architects to combine their demanding careers with caring for children.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of Arch. Design's staff, and with the help of management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operational Programme from funds provided by the European Social Fund and from the State budget of the Czech Republic.
This funding (grants amounting to CZK 2.8 million) enabled the necessary equipment to be provided, as well as providing qualified staff and operations for a period of two years.
After having exhausted the funding (for 2 years), the company Arch.Design is obligated to continue running the mini-kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
Preparing for this project took a whole year, with Economy Rating providing active assistance in processing the applications.
The children are looked after by full-time qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher. Children in kindergarten can attend the kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, although several children take turns playing during the day.
The nursery is flexibly adjusted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights regarding the use of the nursery, regardless of the company's hierarchy and their respective positions.
Although it is about individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the framework programme of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but also receive excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to pre-school lessons, as well as English.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a calculator available for children.
What's more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can always have a look at the children, thus avoiding the stress of having to pick the children up late from a kindergarten that is far away.
Parents are therefore using their working time more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships develop here too.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, family-friendly programs that strengthen their HR marketing.
A bone house still fascinates even after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudí.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs are like the spine of a dinosaur, and the balconies are cracked fish-mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
The house with its organic forms was nicknamed '& quot; Bonehouse' by locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splints and mosaics, the shed-like facades and the ubiquitous soft lines are typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures, which remind of nature and living beings.
Only on closer inspection does one realize that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole façade appears even more vivid, more dramatic, and the special illumination adds to the brilliance of the colours.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, door ornaments, even peepholes and moldings.
Batlló is located in the Eixample district, on the lively Passeig de Grácia shopping street at No. 43. Batlló was created through the remodeling of a house dating back to 1877, designed by Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new one, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudi's idea of an unusual and also cheaper remodeling.
However, the apartment building Casa Batlló was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on his drawing board that the decorations for the owner's representative apartment were created, and his idea was also to use mosaics on the façade.
However, numerous other artists and artists also contributed to the design of the façade.
Working together on the designs for Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
This is how Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá in Güell Park, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed 'quot; bonehead' by locals for its organic shapes.
Others called it the & quot; yawning house & quot; due to the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that at the top of the building there is the sword of Saint George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house at the time, featuring ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degree tilt already seems somewhat bizarre.
In his work Gaudí consistently ignored all building regulations of the time and did not let himself be deterred by these.
Before construction started, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city's fathers were so shocked by the result when it was completed two years later that they demanded a remedy.
The councillors were offended by the fact that the building, with its pillars, even interfered with the public pavement.
However, there have been no changes; on the contrary, only fifteen days after the district requested this, Josep Batlló submitted a request for permission to lease the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a parlour, on the 3rd floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor has been leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building passes through a staircase up to the rooftop terrace.
By the basic elements of the conversion, all right-angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, allowing a larger company to chat comfortably, without having to give up a certain intimacy for more private conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house was renovated by Gaudí and given a rather unusual roof and two further floors.
Gaudí's play with light is also impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles covering the courtyard and the atriums of light.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply applied the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colours, which, on the contrary, absorb the sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, inscribed in UNESCO's World Heritage List in 2005, is now open to everyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is opened to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was determined that this was a fairly profitable business, the visits were retained, and even extended to further common rooms and the attic rooms, including the rooftop terrace.
The price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard cut, it is 16,50 Euro, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get 20% reduction.
This amount exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the real atmosphere of the house with its little dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the inhabitants of the house and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the best bed frame, but the quality of the bed - mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many factors play a role in the selection - the sleeper's weight, height, state of health, and last but not least - the sleeper' s gender.
Equally important is the interior, in which the mattress and rust have to subordinate each other.
Typical example?
In a weekend home that does not have regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to & quot; warm up & quot;.
Moreover, they are significantly heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough ventilation ducts in the core, and are lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not impossible that mould will develop underneath them.
When you vote, what you are used to naturally plays a role.
If you have been abroad for a long period of time, where very high mattresses with soft layers are common, it is difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
& quot; Probably all of the ice hockey players who have returned from the NHL complained to me that they could no longer sleep properly here. & quot;
& quot; For their stripped shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of viscisco foam (Memory Foam). & quot;
& quot; Among other things, I recommend this type of person who has diabetes, who suffers from a nervous system disorder, which makes it difficult for them to receive the & quot; information from the joints and skin, 'explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
This is why I have provided many years ago ice hockey players, as well as other customers, with these mattresses covered in memory foam.
& quot; Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico. & quot;
And you don 't have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the benefits of viscose foam.
This & quot; wonder & quot; actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally fits into the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, in the night you do not roll around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (gangrene).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles of the feet, i. e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Both a man and a woman, who are 180 cm tall, need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are appropriate.
For the sake of convenience, and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: & quot; If you are lying down, there should be enough space for your slightly angled arms, advises Helena Prokopová, the guildmaster of upholstery and interior decoration, who has been working on the problematic of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years now, and who also teaches this topic at technical colleges.
When it comes to a double bed, everyone needs to have their own grate and mattress, but be careful when shopping, so the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is no choice but to mount the grates at different heights, which is by no means possible for every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be used for the mould layer and the fine pad.
& quot; Do not feel the springs by hand or while sitting down, warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully cushioned beds with mattress and pad like conjoined Siamese twins have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is now quite common.
And since you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will slowly become a huge (and clogged) sieve.
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a life of up to 25 years, even life-long guarantee for mattresses.
Each thing has its ifs and buts.
And here is some practical advice from the distributors: for mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from hygiene of the washable, removable covers, however, it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily peeled and washed.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with a full-length zipper, so that you get two halves after you open the mattress (extremely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often feels like a David vs. Goliath unequal match.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a grate?
Get Me Out Of Here!
Or, at most, for one bed for unloved guests and one night only.
Even so, it is better to add ventilation holes (if there are none yet) and to use mattresses with a feather skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm, with what are known as pocket springs and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-adjustable bed frames with 14 to 18 slats (slats) latex or sandwich mattresses (possibly also combinations of latex and coco), it always pays to use a larger number of frames, i. e. 28 or more spring frames, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae and the possibility to adjust the hardness of the frames.
Adjustable slats do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton because they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
Besides setting the stiffness of the connectors, special flexible shoulder modules are offered.
This is a special attachment of the connectors, which allows to press or even bend the connectors in such a way, that they allow the selective sinking of the shoulder of the sleeper.
This is an important issue, especially for men with broad shoulders.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using & quot; Men's Mattresses & quot; Soft Zones for the shoulder area.
There is also a thought for the ladies - they are treated to these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing springs (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsional springs are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the pressure.
But - if you use a bad (too big and stuffy) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most of the advantages are lost.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, with the tips reaching only down to the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can relax.
An ideal pillow is 50 x 60 cm in size, as the Scandinavians like it.
In the lateral position, the cushion (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old straw sacks (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
For mattresses, too, the new magic word is & quot; Bio & quot;.
Increasingly natural oils - castor and soybean oil, for example - are being used to produce polyurethane foams instead of crude oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
& quot; In the case of mattresses, & quot; means that their core consists of materials of purely natural origin, explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first being aloe vera.
You can also treat yourself to microcapsules that smell fresh forest or lavender when you sleep.
Again, a distinction is made between man and woman.
For men, a & quot; cooling & quot; plant extract from birch leaves is used to help the mattress cover absorb the heat and cool the body, for women, the covers have a warming & quot; effect.
Extracts of red pepper pods stimulate the blood circulation, so it is pleasant and warm to the weaker sex when they sleep.
And today's favourites?
Cold foam mattresses (with larger pores and destroyed cell structures, more breathable than standard polyurethane, and much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness of cold foaming and Viisco foaming results in multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip, and heels are.
However, you have to shell out 7000 kronor more for a high quality mattress.
However, health mattresses are usually charged less VAT because they are considered to be medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to receive this benefit.
You can see it's not that easy to save on the mattress and the rust.
Occasionally, there are special offers from manufacturers and retailers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, Magniflex offers the Duofreeze quilted Visco Memory Foam for CZK 11,990.
You can get the second one for free.
It was Tempur, the material that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and high density, at an almost cosmic pace.
It is no wonder, because they were developed for the NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempur becomes soft when exposed to heat, and solidifies in cool environments.
This way it perfectly adapts to the human body and optimally distributes the pressure of the body.
This makes it not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but also improves sleep comfort in general.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are designed to ease the legs and blood vessels.
Domestic manufacturers use Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to keep kids under control
The fear for own children grows, so more and more parents consider monitoring them with GPS.
The system, which was invented to search for cars, can also locate human beings, which is useful in cases like the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet, but it soon won 't be any bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people are terrified by the case of Anička, who disappeared, and so they are looking for ways and means to better protect their children.
Also at the price of an infringement of their privacy.
& quot; We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood of tragedy, cites Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
& quot; I acknowledge that in isolated cases, such devices may be misused, for example, putting it in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not had any such case. & quot;
& quot; Most customers really purchase it for security reasons, adds Pilin.
However, he believes that the child should always know what the & quot; box is for, and how to use it in case of emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, they simply get rid of them.
& quot; Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to deliberately losing certain things when they do not want to be controlled. & quot;
& quot; Mobile phones raised great expectations among parents at first, but they are just as easy to turn off as these new & quot; surveillance devices, notes Ms. Bočková.
In her opinion, it is also disputed whether such an institution actually helps in case of an attack.
& quot; During planned kidnappings, the kidnapper virtually always checks if the child has any electronics with him or her that could be used to locate him or her. & quot;
& quot; Today it's the mobile phone. & quot;
& quot; If such monitoring devices were to be used more widely, they would also seek them, since their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising. & quot;
& quot; In these cases, criminals are always one step ahead of the police, notes the psychologist.
However, it acknowledges that similar devices can be useful in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of RC Monitoring, which provides tracking services for cars as well as individuals, the existence of such a device may help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
& quot; This is because the device can be configured to report the position of the device at certain intervals. & quot;
& quot; Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available. & quot;
& quot; On more expensive devices, a clinometer is built in, which means that if you fall and remain motionless, the device will immediately send a warning indicating the position of & quot;, claims Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, all you have to do is download some special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that they are either match-box-sized devices that resemble trailers, or smaller ones.
There is always a danger of losing them.
Therefore, according to Mr Pilin of Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital watches are currently being tested.
& quot; This has the advantage that the potential attacker does not have to know that he or she is dealing with a monitoring or locating device.
& quot; Or he only notices this after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a head start. & quot;, he adds.
No matter in which direction the trend is headed, towards wristbands or pendants, the same technology is always used as for vehicle locating.
This is a combination of the location function using the GPS system (the same as with the car satnav) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many cords that you could wrap whole Czech Republic around it, but it would only last two years
The Czech army purchased 445 km of fuses to detonate with IEDs.
The year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of fuse cord to the army camps.
It is comforting to know that the Armed Forces have served for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the fuses - two years, but no more than four.
The army bought the fuses from the public limited company STV Group, a. s., for a paltry 40 million kronor.
In its justification for purchasing this enormous amount of fuse, the General Staff of MF DNES replied that the soldiers consume approximately 60 kilometers of fuse annually.
According to research by army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES raised, this figure shows that the whole army has to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnical training every year, from all the generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army Gen. Vlastimil Picek were not exempt.
Only in this way can the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be partially justified.
This length corresponds to 25.000 detonations.
But even so, these armies would last for more than a decade.
However, if the old rule of experts is still applicable, that for the training of each new professional soldier two meters of fuse will suffice, then with these new purchases - also in view of the increased need of the Pioneer and Special Forces - the army has created a calming supply for the aforementioned 225 years.
Soldiers from the Rapid Deployment Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense, Vondra, that they almost ran out of small arms cartridges, so that practice shooting is severely restricted due to a lack of resources.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
& quot; Nor can I fathom why they are buying such vast quantities of ignition cords from us. & quot;
But that is ultimately up to them, they will know what they need them for. & quot;
& quot; The army is a good customer for us, and we as the trader want to meet it as best we can, says Jan Děcký, STV Group Sales Manager.
Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of fuse by saying that this would have kept the army stocking up with this & quot; ammunition for at least 10 years.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group only speaks of a four-year service life of the fuses, and the police and army pyrotechnician only speaks of a two-year service life.
& quot; With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably possible, admits one of them, who wishes to remain anonymous so as not to be accused of criticizing the army.
At the end of their useful life, any type of ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable or if it will endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not free of charge, they cost additional money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometer fuse.
& quot; They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers', spokesman Pejšek informs us of the position of the purchasers from the Ministry of Defence.
Just for comparison: for some years now, the annual consumption of cord ignitions by police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from World War II or the Soviet fraternal army has barely exceeded 1,500 meters.
And the police always order only those quantities of ammunition that can be used up before the period of use ends.
Already for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, one keeps open the possibility for flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable ignitions.
The Ministry of Defence is already facing huge problems in winding up tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the Warsaw Treaty, as the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovak People's Army prepared to march on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians mentioned by MF DNES, in a few years' time the Czech Armed Forces will have the same problem with liquidating hundreds of kilometres' old fuses that they now purchase cheaply.
To date, I have enjoyed the contacts I have won thanks to the contest.
Winner of the place in the competition & quot; small entrepreneur of the year & quot; helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
Last year's winner of the & quot; Small Entrepreneur of the Year award was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked travelling.
Only abroad did he realize that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
With the savings of his holidays abroad and a bank loan, he bought a ramshackle house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a sixth-form college student at the time, this was certainly a courageous venture.
& quot; The then price-to-quality ratio annoyed me, so I tried to do something about it, says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all the profits into the house, which he gradually converted into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has opened four pensions, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all accommodation categories.
Until recently, the most comfortable of these was the four star & quot; Pytloun Design Hotel & quot;
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
& quot; Just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we sold our franchise concept, and other interested parties in the Pytloun franchise have already contacted us, says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
& quot; Just won the & quot; Entrepreneur of the Year & quot; award, Mr. Pytloun adds appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater fame, even popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
& quot; People recognized me in the street, many times they even congratulated me afterwards, and I have to say, that was really good & quot;, "he remembers.
I really recommend it to everyone who wants to create something, to participate in this contest.
You do not have to win immediately, each visualization is good.
He says that to this day he is benefiting from the contacts and acquaintances that would not have happened otherwise.
& quot; I continue to maintain regular business relationships with some of the people I met through the contest.
The fame associated with success, he says, also has a little effect on each of his collaborators.
And since he has at the seventy.
& quot; I notice a greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something receiving universal recognition. & quot;
Also, I really do not just see this as a personal achievement, no, it is the result of the good work done by all of us. & quot;
& quot; My name has only become somewhat prominent & quot;, Lukáš Pytloun says modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his single mindedness Farmet has overcome the worst.
The first place prize of last year's Vodafone Company of the Year award went to Karel Žďárský, owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury praised his efforts in turning the small tool shop in Česká Skalice into a company generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue.
& quot; I can say that this recognition has encouraged not only myself, but also all of my collaborators, and strengthened our self-confidence in the battle with the competition. & quot;, says last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop as a compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, giving up his career in the company where he had been employed until then, and with a few of his father's friends, starting his own company producing plastic tubs.
A short while later, they started focusing on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they became the largest producer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through her success in the aforementioned competition and her mediation that she entered the consciousness of the non-professional public.
& quot; Not only did our customers perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners started to value the opportunity to collaborate with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, says Karel Žďárský.
The past year was not only dominated by the euphoria of victory for Farmet.
The assessment was based on the Company's financial results for 2008 and part of 2009.
And 2009 in particular was the most difficult year for tool making product sales.
The crisis, which at the time was still less shaking the citizens but mainly shaking businesses, was at its height - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new equipment and technologies.
& quot; Of course, we could not escape this situation. & quot;
& quot; Revenues fell by 40%, we had to scale back production and even resort to layoffs, Karel Žďárský explains
Sometimes a viable company has to take such unpopular measures as well.
However, it managed to get a grip of the situation and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one case, the company was unwilling to make sacrifices - on R & D investments.
& quot; From the grant we built a research and training center, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and won major prizes at domestic exhibitions & quot;, says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
The turnovers grow again, and with them also the number of new employees.
& quot; I wish the new victor much pleasure in winning - but in a more peaceful atmosphere, & quot; will host Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll cleaning up the act of nonsensical rules
The poll of the & quot; absurdity of the year, & quot; is part of the entrepreneurship competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical rules have already succeeded in eliminating the world.
The dubious winner of the next volume of the & quot; Absurdity of the Year & quot; was the duty to create documents on authorities available online.
More than a third of less than four thousand entrepreneurs voted.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper statement from the trade register, even if the civil servant could have retrieved it by clicking two mouse buttons.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
& quot; The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the trade register when it checks social security payers, said Jana Buraňová, spokeswoman for the Czech Social Security Agency.
The whole point of & quot; The & quot; Absurdity of the Year & quot; is to examine all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This is the fourth time this year that the competition has been organized by the Czech Business Newspaper (HN) and it has become increasingly popular among the general public.
If approximately three thousand people took part in the vote last year, this year there were already four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations, which serve only to hinder the business activity.
& quot; For example, in terms of the number of income tax forms, we rank first in the world, notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of companies, eight places lower than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in the year and takes place in the same scenario every year.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the competition 'deadline at the end of September.
Register at www.firmaroku.cz. The organizer of the contest will select seven candidates for the & quot; Antipreis & quot; and will let the public vote via the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year's opinion poll has already registered more than one hundred, 105 useless rules and regulations.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated & quot; finalists of the competition are, for example, provisions requiring maintenance vehicles to pay tolls for highways and expressways, or requiring entrepreneurs with twenty employees to install two offices and two toilets every two years.
The list of this year's & quot; Seven' s & quot; has been published on the competition's pages.
The proclamation of the competition, held in Prague's Wenceslas Square at the beginning of November, is part of a series of events regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Republic Chamber of Commerce, participated in the highlight of the competition.
& quot; If the state sticks the entrepreneurs in the throat, there can be no real economic recovery. Therefore, my goal is to repeal at least thirty articles every year, which today still unnecessarily complicate the entrepreneurs' endeavours, announced Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical arrangements are having an effect.
In 2007, the most annoying thing was the duty imposed on the entrepreneurs to notify the trade office at their permanent establishment of their intention to go to an exhibition or fair with a booth three days in advance.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The duty, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labour Office business trips of employees of up to 30 days - was abolished by the Act on them so-called "& quot; Green Card".
And - all good things come in threes:
The absurdity of 2009 was the regulation requiring physiotherapists to have a mirror, a fridge, and two bathroom scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat softened by the Ministry of Health this year - the fridge-freezer requirement was dropped.
A New Category Honors Socially Responsible Companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's, already fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category & quot; Responsible Company of the year 2010 & quot;.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair enterprises.
& quot; We want to support those companies that are aware of the environmental consequences of their business activities, and support socially responsible initiatives, said Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of Vodafone's mobile phone business, who is herald and guarantor of this competition, as well as of the & quot; Rebel of the Year & quot;.
This year, the first year of this special sub-category of the main Vodafone Company of the Year award, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal have registered.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and would provide enough material for a stand-alone article.
Although they differ diametrically in the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have one common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about handicapped people, personal problems or the health of one's own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists, from all over the Czech Republic, there was the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a handicapped children's trust for seventeen years now.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also takes an exemplary care of disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce, for which it was awarded the title & quot; Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region & quot; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it came third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the winner was MiRyz Soft, an accounting firm, which introduced fluid working hours, which were reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without any proportionate reduction in wages.
In awarding the prize, the jury also acknowledged the fact that the company mainly purchases products from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens' initiatives in its vicinity, and operates according to environmentally friendly principles.
& quot; We strive to recycle as much as possible, in order to minimize the environmental impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration, explains its Managing Director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústí nad Labem, on the other hand, is concerned about the health of its employees and therefore has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all its notebooks, as well as home work for its employees and the use of carting services provided by a home-based protected workshop for company activities.
& quot; We also support the & quot; Foundation, which provides tangible assistance to the Roma community here at home,'says Ondřej Suchý, the company' s representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company & quot; Praní a čištění & quot; from the Karlovy Vary Region, which contributes to the pension insurance of its employees in the form of extra bonuses, is worthy of mention.
& quot; We give our employees subsidies for food, for the commute to work, to increase their skills and for their holidays & quot; says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
In the category Responsible Company of the Year, all district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered. They will answer the questions of the questionnaire accompanying the registration and will be sent to the Organiser by August 15 at the latest.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire have been excluded from the assessment by the organizer.
& quot; If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the & quot; Responsible Company of the Year contest, but were not disqualified in the main competition, Vodafone Company of the Year. & quot;
& quot; It is not possible to submit a separate entry only for this contest because it is only a sub-category of the main & quot; Company of the Year contest, explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & amp; Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of police in public tender
At the Soil Fund building in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police have been making arrests over the last few days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was led away in handcuffs by detectives.
The latter allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition were allocated to a concrete interested party.
The latter is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million.
& quot; At this time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the offence of fraud in a public competition, 'Antonie Zelená, Director of Public Prosecution, told the newspaper' quot; Právo & quot;,'she was unable to provide any further details in light of the ongoing investigation.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released by police.
Given the scarcity of official information, one can only speculate how he managed to manipulate the public competition.
Lubomír Černá, spokeswoman of the Soil Fund, stated in response to Právo's question that the police had actually arrested the Soil Fund' s branch in Pilsen, during a public competition.
& quot; It was about a client, and by no means one of our employees, & quot;, she explained.
According to Mrs Černá, the public competition had the correct name & quot; request for bidding entitlements to transfer land under the land law & quot; and would take place in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the offered plot.
& quot; These persons offer, in the context of the request, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled through the transfer than the declared real estate value. & quot;
& quot; The order of the prospective buyers is determined according to the claims being offered, and then the Soil Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest offer, & quot;, explains the Fund's spokeswoman.
Luboš G. obviously had information available as to who had logged in at the request, and as he himself was a legitimate person, having purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered to withdraw from the competition to a real estate interest.
Evidently against a fat compensation.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had good contacts to Pilsen Soil Fund in the past.
He played a role in the causa of the former head of the Soil Fund, Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in substitute restitutions for which decisions had already been taken on sites for construction projects.
At the time Luboš G. acquired land from the Land Fund, for example, land intended for the construction of public roads, specifically, on the site where the main access road to the Borské pole industrial park was planned to be built.
Later he exchanged them very cheaply with the magistrate for a house right in the historical centre of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At the time, the city council had to acquiesce with a heavy heart in order not to jeopardise the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs are rising by a few hundred per month
From January onwards, households will not only have to face higher costs for all types of energy, but will also have to pay higher water and waste water charges, as well as higher rents for district heating and in some places rents.
As of January, families will have to withdraw several hundred kroner more per month from their wallet than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6% more expensive, gas will be up to 2% more expensive, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places district heating will be more expensive.
The cost of electricity alone is increasing by several hundred kronor per year.
The high-voltage electricity prices were lowered by all main suppliers, which is mainly due to the significant promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic systems.
Gas will become only moderately more expensive, but only when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here too, one can expect a few hundred more kronor per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, district heating prices vary from city to city.
Larger cities, in particular, are planning price increases.
For example, from January households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kronor more per month for district heating, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kronor more per year.
The inhabitants of Prague, on the other hand, face 9% higher water and sewerage charges if the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest in the whole of the Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and waste water charges will increase by 7.4%.
Huge increases in rents are to be expected in 140,000 rental apartments, for example, for which the so-called rent regulation ceases to apply from January onwards.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by 100% from January onwards.
The company wants to take legal action against anyone who does not agree to this rent increase.
Regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 homes, are expected to rise by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and Rum beer is out - it just works too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once in a while a good whisky, stolen from your father's house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen are most likely to need emergency treatment.
No exception is children who have to sleep off their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is apparent from the experience of doctors who have faced similar cases in the reception of children's departments at clinics.
& quot; beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk. & quot;
& quot; Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol & quot;, said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief physician of the paediatric department at Hořovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
& quot; Whisky, if it succeeds in stealing a bottle from the father's house bar, if it does not, at least Fernet or Vodka.
& quot; Vodka has the advantage of being mixed with Juice, because it does not smell as strong as & quot;, explains the chief physician.
The spokeswoman of the Motol Eva Jurinová faculty hospital agrees.
& quot; The most common topic is Fernet or Rum. & quot;
& quot; This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools. & quot;
& quot; There were also occasional references to Slibowitz, which you take home, Ms Jurinová pointed out.
According to Chief Pelikan, thirteen or fourteen year old drinkers are by no means an exception when admitted to hospital.
Prior to the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, for ten years he worked in the paediatric department of Motol Hospital, where ambulance crews delivered intoxicated students from near and far.
& quot; A girl had to be hospitalized four times. & quot;
& quot; Her career began at the age of 12 when she was admitted for the first time with 3.5% alcohol in her blood and in combination with & quot; Extase & quot;, the doctor described a particularly severe case.
& quot; She was at some sort of dance party at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice. & quot;
& quot; The interesting thing was that it didn 't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn' t come home for 48 hours & quot;, wonders the chief physician.
Parental lack of interest or their incredible tolerance when toasting their own offspring is considered to be one of the main causes of children's growing alcoholism.
Real dependence in the true sense of the word is not what children are about, according to the experts.
& quot; Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic addiction to alcohol and all associated phenomena, and it is not the case in these children. & quot;
In most cases, those who repeatedly drink alcohol have a negative familial-social background, explains Pelikán.
By mid-November, according to Motol hospital spokeswoman Jurinová, approximately forty drunken children were admitted to the local Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that require hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children taken home after ambulatory treatment by their parents, or possibly by the police, are not registered.
In addition to the cases where children just drink a bottle of liquor at school, according to Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes that children can rely on 100%: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
& quot; The latter for two reasons - either out of grief because of bad testimony or out of joy on vacation. & quot;
& quot; On Walpurgis Night, I have also seen seven drunken children at once in & quot;, emphasizes Doctor Pelikán.
A drunken child who spends the night under the supervision of a doctor is paradoxically better off than a child who only has an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The morning headache caused by dehydration and lack of glucose can be relieved in hospital with a liquid infusion of glucose and nutrients lacking in the body.
& quot; They are clearly better off because after the & quot; wonderful & quot; evening experience, they wake up with a good mood, without anything hurting. & quot;
& quot; They are just a bit confused about where they are, admits Doctor Pelikán, sometimes spoiling patients' good vibes by telling them what the treatment will cost them.
This is because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed often come to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
& quot; Every now and then I have used this as an educational tool, when I have calculated directly to the children during their visit what their drunkenness cost them, and it is quite possible that they will have to work all their holidays to earn the money for a single such party. & quot; added Dr. Pelikán.
However, he believes that health insurance companies do not resort to recourse to recover the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from their parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light combat aircraft out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defence has replaced with the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Sevilla, home to the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been in the possession of a foreign army.
Until now, they have only been seen during maneuvers or air shows abroad.
This is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircraft are single seat L-159s.
These are still conserved in the Aero Vodochody, which was taken over by the intermediary of this transaction - the company Omnipol - last week.
When it physically expedites the aircraft from Vodochody is unknown, according to Jan Pejšek, spokesman of the Ministry of Defense.
The L-159 single-seat combat aircraft, on the other hand, were segregated from long-haul aircraft, with no further contribution or investment from the ministry's portfolio.
& quot; The two-seater L-159T1 has been exchanged in current condition and appearance, said Pejšek of the Právo newspaper.
He added that the Army will not have to operate without two-seater combat aircraft because in May 2009, the Department of Defense signed a $200 million contract with Aero Vodochody to convert four redundant L-159 aircraft into a two-seater version.
One new aircraft was acquired by the army in July, with the second one planned for the army by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to integrate the fighter aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
& quot; The contract states very clearly that EADS is a purchaser of the L-159 aircraft and that these aircraft are to be used for the training of pilots from NATO countries.
& quot; It is therefore up to the purchaser to decide how to implement the & quot;, explained Pejšek.
The Business Times (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The bartering of five L-159s for a Casa transport aircraft and the purchase of additional aircraft for CZK 3.5 billion was approved last year by Mirek Topolánek's government.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not put out a tender notice for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Secretary of Defense argued that this bargain will facilitate the future export of the L-159 overseas.
The Czech army bought 72 aircraft from Aero, of which only 24 are used, with the remainder sold.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa is likely to have a legal repercussions, by the way.
The European Commission referred the Czech Ministry of Defence to the European Court of Justice. The reason: it had to select the aircraft based on a pan-European tender procedure, and not by targeting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes, with the last scheduled to land at Kbely Airport within a fortnight.
Longer index finger than ring finger means lower risk of developing cancer
Men who have a longer index finger than the ring finger are obviously less likely to develop prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be linked to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
& quot; Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty years old. & quot;, said the study's co-author, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should definitely undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health issues, Ms Eeles added.
Between 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer, as well as 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men were as likely to develop prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, this risk decreased by 33 percent for men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, and even decreased by 87 percent for men up to the age of sixty.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which form already in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the womb.
Less testosterone equals a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that it is precisely testosterone that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Czech Academy of Sciences, said he was briefly familiar with the study, but he does not think the relationship between finger length and cancer risk was' fully proven '.
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 blocked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic was blanketed in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and pavements are mostly covered with frozen snow, and the winter servicemen were on their way all night long.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to accidents involving heavy goods vehicles and cars, and the D1 motorway near Brno is also closed in the direction of Prague.
This was said by Novinksy. CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
A lorry crashed at kilometre 91, and two lorries collided at kilometre 93, resulting in injuries.
A few cars are also in the ditch.
Problems are also encountered at kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Again, two trucks collided.
The riders should leave behind Brno at km. 190 or drive through Brno and drive up at km. 182 near Kývalka.
This is where congestion stretches for kilometres.
There was also an accident on the D11 motorway, on the approach to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a snow cover several centimeters thick, and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Motorcades are forming in the Prosek district, for example, and Štěrboholská Street is also completely clogged.
The safest mode of transport is definitely the Metro.
Trams are running with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o 'clock in the morning, the Prague Crisis Group meets.
There are also problems at the railways and airports.
Czech State Railways had to cancel seven fast trains due to snow drifts.
Problems can occur, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers should check the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně has been closed from 11am until 5am.
Most roads in Southern Moravia are only accessible with a high degree of caution.
Three secondary roads are completely impassable around Vyškov, snow drifts are forming in places around Brno, and snowblowers are needed on some roads higher up in the Blansko area.
One of the most affected regions is Výškov.
There are still three roads completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Again, you will have to use a snow blower to clear the snow.
Until now, it has not been possible to predict when they will become passable again.
In the Hodonín region, caution is advised in the area of the White Carpathians.
Roads which, due to conservation reasons, may only be sprinkled with inert litter are covered with snow up to five centimeters thick, explained ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimeters, mostly in Northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimeters in places.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slowly starting to snow.
American soldiers have a new & quot; smart weapon & quot;.
For the first time, the American troops have deployed a new & quot; smart & quot; weapon in Afghanistan, which is only known under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the local conflict with the Taliban, and will shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are guided to the finish by a laser with a precision of only a few meters.
The special bullets of caliber 25 mm, which were specially designed for this rifle and contain high explosive explosive material, work practically like small grenades.
The missiles can be programmed to explode at any point in their ballistic trajectory, not just on impact.
This means that it can be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, a wall, or in a trench.
This is because he is usually not protected from the air, so the murderous Steel Chisel from above could easily knock him out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who helped develop the XM-25, the new assault rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of & quot; intelligent & quot; technologies.
& quot; The soldier basically proceeds as follows: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he gains an exact sights point after which he corrects the raise angle, then he only has to pull the trigger.
& quot; Let's say, you measured 543 m. & quot;
& quot; When you pull the trigger, the weapon recharges and fires the bullet at a distance of 543 yards, plus minus one, two, or three yards.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu relocates its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese company Fujitsu relocates its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the industry giant, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, on Wednesday, in July next year 400 men and women will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, 100 additional jobs of the Group should be accommodated, which have been spread across the region to date.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, in addition, the open-plan offices in the Astro Park better corresponded to the working methods of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg Fujitsu was only a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, & quot; with Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure & quot;.
The excellent connection to the airport is especially important for a global company like Fujitsu.
Yesterday, the relocation of a major company within the region caused joy for the winners and disappointment for the losers.
Frankfurt Economics Commissioner Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was yet another 'quot; global player'.
This is a & quot; great location confession & quot;.
Fujitsu fits to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was notified of the intention by management at an early stage.
& quot; We obviously offered our help & quot;, said Korwisi.
Friendly contacts could not have solved the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Mariánské Lázně's Square.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
The priority now, he said, is to prevent a long vacancy rate in such a prominent position.
& quot; I hope the owner and landlord of the building proves cooperative. & quot;
The Fujitsu House on Rathausplatz and the neighboring & quot; Kleine Vertikale & quot;, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz, were among the most controversial developments in the spa city ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city park was created between the station and the city hall, which attracted criticism due to the massive development of the areas that had been partially used as parking spaces, as well as the height of the buildings.
In 2001, Feri, the investment advisory and rating company, Start Amadeus, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, and Fujitsu, the computer manufacturer then still affiliated with Siemens, moved into the premises.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund, and resold one year later to Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu Corporation describes itself as the world's third largest IT provider.
It provides computers and servers to companies, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhein-Main region is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has many more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving into Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg. The other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
The twenty-year-old complex - the name refers to its star-shaped layout - is home to, among others, the Central Association of the Electrotechnics and Electronics Industry.
Amazon Locks Down Server - Threats Against Assange
WikiLeaks is coming under increasing pressure.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, however, called on other countries and corporations to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is said to be in Britain, according to a newspaper report.
& quot; Wikileaks ousted from Amazon server. & quot;
& quot; Free Speech in the Land of Free & quot; announced the Revelation activists via Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish the secret diplomatic cables, in order to cope with the high access numbers to the documents.
Via Twitter Wikileaks explained the step further: & quot; Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in europa. & quot;
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, & quot;, they should stop selling books & quot;.
Amazon has suspended Wikileaks' use of its servers after staff members investigated Senator Joe Lieberman, CNN reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the British & quot; Guardian reported.
& quot; I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner given the prior publication of classified information by Wikileaks & quot;,'said the Senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from other countries.
& quot; Wikileaks & apos; illegal, egregious and reckless action puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe & quot;, 'the non-partisan senator said in a statement.
& quot; No responsible company, American or foreign, should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material. & quot;
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted on rape charges by authorities in Sweden, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report by the London newspaper & quot; The Independent & quot;, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK, and the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigation in Sweden a conspiracy by his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there have been threats.
& quot; There were even calls for Julian Assange to be murdered. & quot;
So Assange is right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will continue to hide out.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - obviously ironically - on television that Assange should & quot; be killed & quot; and Obama could & quot; use a drone & quot;.
Meanwhile, an exchange of gunfire erupted between the White House and Assange.
US President Barack Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs called it' ridiculous' and 'absurd' that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently leaked espionage claims made to diplomats.
& quot; I am not quite sure why we care about a guy's opinion with a web page & quot;, says Gibbs.
& quot; Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one website. & quot;
The US government is now taking a major look at the protection of its databases.
The Deputy Director of the Center for Counter-terrorism Action, Russell Travers, has been appointed as Special Representative, the White House announced.
Travers was responsible for developing necessary & quot; structural reforms that became necessary following the disclosure of the embassy reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to review ways the entire government shares information and protects it.
The US administration also announced that it would provide security for dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the WikiLeaks publication.
& quot; We have made every effort to get in touch with them & quot;, said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
& quot; We stand ready to protect it if it becomes necessary. & quot;
The Ice-Cream University
At & quot; Gelato University & quot; near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for better seasons.
The basic three-day course for prospective Gelatieri has the largest number of visitors and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatiere and from the gelataio.
Gelatiere, in English somewhat ancient the ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream-makers.
The gelataio pulls the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter with a spatula, strokes the ice cream into the waffle, and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell 'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can't go past the & quot; Gelato-University & quot; of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice Cream University was set up by the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream produced from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest number of visitors and visitors from all over the world.
There are also special courses lasting several days covering chocolate ice cream and internships in the hotel's ice cream parlour.
Some people are dreaming of a new career in their mid-life crisis, others are simply venturing onto the icy cold of their vague longings.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice-cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and after years in a nerve-wracking job wants to bag something own.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
A man from Malta and a man from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her kids love Italian ice cream.
Maestro Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
What is decisive is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
But Luciano doesn 't forget the icing on the national and even the Southern superstructure: & quot; Italian Gelato is just the best - and there' s plenty of romance along the way. & quot;
The first step to creation seems very simple.
Luciano tips the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program, then immediately cools it down to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is bombarded with questions: Can you only make ice cream with natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can you let your lust for experimentation run wild?
Luciano warns against letting himself be led astray by the zeitgeist.
If you are talking about ice cream & quot; made only from natural ingredients & quot;, you may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guarar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabilizer, but you have to sell it within one day, otherwise it will collapse and the customer will bite.
Certain variations of the base mass are allowed.
Things become more exciting with the flavours.
For the taste of the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that one purchases in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
& quot; The suppliers will all try to turn you dozens of flavored additives. & quot;
& quot; But you should just experiment. & quot;
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or, for example, the ice cream made from the basic white mass, which turns into a yellow cream with the addition of eggs, and cocoa powder, which is the basis for all kinds of chocolate temptations.
Now students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano lets her make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream, with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
Fruit ice creams are subjected to the same experiment.
More flavors, more fruit puree - in terms of flavor, it's not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice cream does not taste necessarily nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water, and slightly less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mixture will really bring out the flavor of a gelato, Luciano says.
Making ice cream is a math task: If you use a peach puree with lots of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano pulls out a device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (winemakers measure the oechsles in the must).
Fortunately, spreadsheets make calculating easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical effort as before.
Not only the device for the automatic preparation of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped creamy and cooled to sub-zero temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small glitches remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo is spraying himself and his fellow students from top to bottom with fruit puree, when the oversized stick blender gets out of control.
& quot; In each course, Maestro Luciano says, & quot; is only a matter of time before something like this happens. & quot;
controllers in twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa is undermined by the industry experimenting with genetically modified plants.
This accusation is now being made by the Testbiotech expert group, which sees itself as the independent Institute for Biotechnology Impact Assessment.
& quot; It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well & quot;, said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbying association Ilsi for many years.
This is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in the Efsa testing regulations for gene plants, and is therefore facing a clear conflict of interests, criticizes Then.
The Efsa rules are paragraphs of text corresponding to Ilsi's position papers, and thus bear the hallmarks of the industry which is actually controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa executive recently joined Swiss agricultural group Syngenta without any strings attached or transition period - and switched sides.
Also the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) recently revealed personal connections between controlling EU authority and industry lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians acutely aware.
However, the Efsa cannot detect a conflict of interest.
You have access to all serious data, including that from the industry, as long as it is of high technical quality, it is said in a statement.
Do not ask the experts working for Efsa to have no contacts to the industry.
You would, however, have to disclose them.
Kuiper acknowledges his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things for risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
On the substance, independent experts such as Then criticize the fact that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding experiment in animals, and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
& quot; We want to know what genetically modified corn does in the field, & quot; says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
& quot; If you are not looking for the risks, how do you find them? & quot; asks Then accusingly.
This is also the view of Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist has been conducting research in genetic engineering since 1994, and currently works at the Technical University of Zurich.
Industry is now trying more and more in Europe, as in the USA, to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left who are not intertwined with corporations.
Studies critical for companies would usually not be published.
& quot; Industry controls security research & quot;, claims Hilbeck.
The Track of Stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, about 400 kilos in all.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of the train station in Stuttgart, tuba on his back.
It was a great experience.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: By September, the diggers had arrived and had begun to break off a large chunk of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was not the same anymore: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multibillion dollar lowering of the station.
When construction came to a halt, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured a few of the chunks.
& quot; These tiles are relics. & quot;
& quot; They must not disappear. & quot;
He raves: & quot; A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy. & quot;
When he sawed one open, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with the pieces.
There is time for tiles.
So does Uli Gsell.
The trail of the Stuttgarter Steine leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his Stein-Reich.
The 44 year old trades old stones.
He bought all the ones that were destroyed in Stuttgart.
& quot; It would be a shame if they were ground to gravel or disappeared to landfill & quot;, he says in his office, a wooden bunker that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when it was reported in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remnants of the North Wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents, for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything about demolition now.
And if it happens, then it is the most sensible thing to do if the tiles continue to be used.
Approximately 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the cuboids, which weigh an average of 80 kilograms, with them at a unit price of 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to give it back during a reconstruction.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
Approximately half of them are still storing in the forest, the rest have long since been sold.
Garden owners, landscapers, home builders.
They said they came from everywhere and dragged away, which the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart Stones of Anstumstumstumps have long since turned into & quot; Mäuerle & quot; or into limitations of herb beds.
& quot; Actually, this gem is nothing special & quot;, says Rongen.
& quot; Wouldn 't be the political component. & quot;
He climbs into his SUV and takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and stopped working, later he studied biology, then he became interested in computers and finally he became a stone trader.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of bricks.
He gathers treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest stone trader in the Republic.
He brakes.
There are artistically hewn sandstones in the snow.
& quot; They once belonged to the Dresdner Marienbrücke & quot;, "he explains.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
& quot; My Favorite Stone. & quot;
You go up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile of red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
& quot; Beautiful Travertine. & quot;
Once the cuboids belonged to the tribune of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Dom Sankt Blasien, tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hand-cut and moved with simple pulleys and oxcarts, he becomes very awe-inspiring.
& quot; It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that. & quot;
He did not become rich, and certainly not as rich as he has become.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, besides stonecutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled down in the forest.
& quot; We work hard, but it is satisfying & quot;, says the remainder recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
Again, there are bricks to be saved.
Talent battle for high-potentials
There is a lot of people at the buffet.
16 students jostle for salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technische Universität Braunschweig and Volkswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to participate in a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are to talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen along the way.
In the competition for the brightest, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls, before they get onto the job market and are wooed by others.
And, because universities do not publish records of students' achievements, they try to capture and capture exceptional talents in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig the car company will be courting the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department hands out ballpoint pens, gummy bears and portfolios with the VW logo.
She tells the promising young talents about internships and student jobs and shows them ways into the company.
Nico Selle from Braunschweig University of Technology is supervising the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: & quot; The students get in touch with industry and gain experience. & quot;
& quot; can simultaneously meet students, look at interesting candidates, and consider who could be considered for employee. & quot;
Such collaborations, Selle notes, are not uncommon.
It was new, that the students were booed so aggressively.
& quot; Otherwise, the focus was more on the & quot; technical project, says Selle.
The battle for newly graduated students is likely to become even fiercer.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
Instead, they must compete and compete especially for highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, over 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to VDI forecasts, the so-called engineer gap will become even greater.
Roman Dykta is hunting for talent at the accounting and consulting firm KPMG.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events, such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt in which participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the USA next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Whoever is allowed to participate will be selected in two rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants will fly to the USA.
When you're beating and beating the high potentials at universities, the guns get bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
& quot; We want to stand out from the crowd with the race. & quot;
& quot; Just a simple sailing trip was too little for us. & quot;
For Dykta, a talent hunter, the bill seems to be coming.
& quot; We remain in touch with all participants in a similar action last year.
& quot; Some are nearing completion and plan to apply to us soon. & quot;, he says.
In addition to direct booing at the campus, small and medium-sized businesses also go rogue at trade fairs in the classic way.
& quot; We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs. & quot;
& quot; Exhibition & quot; at Intersolar, reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at Solarworld, the solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonn-based company employs approximately 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the young generation problem.
There are currently 35 vacancies available on the company website.
& quot; It is very difficult to fill vacancies at the moment. & quot;
& quot; It takes a lot of time and money, & quot; says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, including the University of Freiberg.
& quot; The professors give hints that they can do internships or write their diploma dissertation with us. & quot;
Expensive promotions are not available at the solar specialist.
To do this, the company tries to attract customers with other advantages: a personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and light communication.
& quot; A major corporation often cannot offer & quot;, says HR Manager Stübe.
Money has long ceased to be the main factor in job searches.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld took 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual best-performer list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and looks at the general conditions for employees.
HR Manager Stübe also hopes that the placement will give her more points among job seekers.
& quot; I think applicants should look especially for external reviews about a potential employer & quot;, she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that, according to Kriegler, means mostly internal measures.
& quot; The best way to become attractive as an employer is through your own employees, & quot;, says he.
In industry jargon, this means internal employer branding within the company's own workforce.
& quot; Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors. & quot;
If you treat your people well and they identify themselves with the company, then they would naturally advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances.
& quot; This is like playing with gang & quot; says Kriegler.
Obama Stops New Oil Drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
The government in Washington issued a ban to this effect - and thus permanently revoked its earlier plans.
New drilling remains prohibited off the Atlantic coast.
The news was announced by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, was the explosion of the & quot; Deepwater Horizon & quot; rig in April.
Prior to the disaster, which claimed the lives of 11 workers and led to the largest environmental disaster in the US, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to authorize new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the USA on oil supplies from abroad.
The responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been fully established.
The British energy company BP, which is facing billions in claims, is at the centre of the criticism.
An investigation commission on behalf of Obama is scheduled to present its findings during the month of December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security, Obama and Salazar want to avoid another disaster.
At present, the competent supervisory authority, which was brought into disrepute following numerous allegations of corruption, is undergoing a radical reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
Industry is now issuing a public warning that tighter regulation in the Gulf will reduce production significantly than has hitherto been the case.
& quot; The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil & gas industry & quot; is the result of a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO - even before Wednesday' s drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what exactly will change with regulation. & quot;
Investment in new subsidies would be postponed until further notice, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, and has a petrol station-like smell: Billions of litres of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland, Nigeria.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
& quot; Don 't give up & quot;, the eco-activist calms the journalists: & quot; You' ll get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today. & quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading into the water to his chest with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene appears almost pretty.
There is no sign of brown crude oil vapours floating beneath the surface.
In the past, she used to gather shrimps in buckets, Esther Badom explains on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the inertia of flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil leaked from a ruptured pipeline into the vast wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters: Ogoniland, in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered to be one of the most polluted regions in the world.
Driving through the mangrove swamps crisscrossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat churches up brown broth, and anyone who dips his hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black licorice sticks out of the ground, sad sporadic palm trees let hang their fronds.
In vain, one looks for flocks of birds, as is usually the case in wetlands: As soon as the outboard is silent, ghostly silence spreads into the former paradise, which smells like a petrol station.
& quot; What is happening here is ecological warfare & quot;, Celestine Akpobari sinister says: & quot; We live in constant danger to health. & quot;
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a disputed battleground for decades: it was here that the first explorers from Europe arrived more than 60 years ago, where the first resistance was organized in the 1980s, with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, and where the Shell company had to cease production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is still barred from returning to Ogoniland: while more than two million barrels of black gold are being pumped daily from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipeline, the oil fields in Ogoniland remain fallow, and the situation is too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames rise out of the water like bizarre sculptures: & quot; Christmas Trees & quot; The heads of the boreholes are called far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the marrow.
Again and again, such a well breaks apart, Akpobari says, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta ecosystem over the last 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil that leaked into the sea off Alaska following the accident of the super tanker & quot; Exxon Valdez & quot; 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
There is a dispute about who is to blame for the continuing eco-meltdown.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90% of the pollution, environmentalists see burst wellheads and leaking pipelines as major culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell applies much lower security standards than is usually applied in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is many times higher than elsewhere.
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open sky, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are bare as a splinter and smeared with oil up to their necks.
A fire is flickering beneath one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to pipes and some of which can be seen scattered arbitrarily around the site: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil above the fire is heated for several hours, explains Michael, the boss of the group.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collector, later at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel trickle out.
For example, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of 300 liters of diesel per day: & quot; This brings us 34,000 naira ($22).
The delta people are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state of Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal stoves can still undercut the ridiculously low price for diesel, which is just under 40 euro cents per litre: they get their raw material for free.
It comes from & quot; bunkers tapping the pipeline network across Ogoniland: according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day across the Niger Delta.
Only a tiny fraction of the temporarily stored raw material is processed illegally, however: the lion's share is stuffed into tankers by organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military officers, who sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate whether the environmental disaster is due to the hustle and bustle of the population or to lax production methods purely academic.
& quot; If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders, and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of fishermen so thoroughly, there would be no sabotage, theft, and illegal refineries. & quot;
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell has been so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the company would be considered: & quot; Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better. & quot;
Michael gets nervous.
& quot; High time you disappeared & quot;, says the muscular oilman.
& quot; Every minute the soldiers can come. & quot;
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they will not be threatened with arrest, but they will be offered a painful bribe.
The soldiers, mostly from the north of the country, want to profit from the raw material - like all Nigerians.
& quot; This damn stuff brought our country to the dog in every way, & quot; says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous build-up error in A380's engines
The A380 seems to have a major security problem.
Investigators investigating an emergency landing of a plane discovered a possible build error that could lead to a & quot; catastrophic engine failure & quot;.
The airline Qantas is now planning to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the emergency landing of a Qantas Airbus at the beginning of November seem to have had much better luck than previously known: The Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigation - and is now warning of a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have severe consequences: if connected to an oil hose, it could cause fatigue cracks and leaks, the ATSB agency said in a statement released Thursday.
This could have led to a catastrophic engine failure.
Affected are Rolls-Royce engines in 20 A380 series aircraft.
This includes the Qantas Airbus which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She filed a statement of claim in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing him to pursue further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would seek damages for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the fire of the engine parts had come loose and damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
Up to 40 engines worldwide now need to be replaced following the incident.
The Australian investigators announced to perform further safety tests on the Superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The security recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue has been deemed sufficiently important to be reported to all affected parties.
For weeks after the Qantas plane made an emergency landing, the airline kept its A380 fleet grounded.
Singapore Airlines temporarily dropped about three of its 11 A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa switched engines on an A380 as a precaution.
The double-decker plane is the largest airliner in the world.
Statewide Snow Triggers Traffic Chaos
Germany all in white: Snow fell overnight in almost all of the country.
There is chaos on many streets, with trains and flights cancelled.
Car crashes have killed at least three people.
Winter is freezing in Germany: freezing temperatures mean that almost the entire Republic has snowed in during the night leading to Thursday - causing traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow blankets.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly blowing snow.
Heavy gusts also hit the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from mid-morning onwards, with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal.
In Saxony, drifting snow caused significant problems on highways and highways.
According to the Severe Weather Centre Meteomedia, this was the reason why the purple alert level was announced in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell, fresh and strong winds blew the snow.
There several trucks and cars got stuck during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt too, the police authorities reported major disruptions on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind caused traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by snow falls.
According to Deutscher Bahn, there are major disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails, or destroyed trolleys and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train travelling to Munich had to stop.
The 165 passengers were provided with blankets, food and drink on the train by firemen and rescue workers.
Winds of snow swept across the roads.
At major airports in Germany, the snowy winds are causing numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a Fraport spokeswoman, already 40 flights have been cancelled.
Winter Service would be in constant use.
While there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still nearly 400 beds available for them.
Accidents have already occurred on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed when he collided with a train at a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The engineer was slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was detected on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she rolled over with her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
But the meteorologists have one piece of good news: The snow will still be loose and powdery, and will therefore start to swirl up during light gusts.
But the wind will ease.
Only the Baltic Sea is battered by fast-moving winds.
However, it remains very cold - down to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its Twin Towers
Deutsche Bank wants to part ways with its landmark: According to a newspaper report, Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just beautified its corporate headquarters: the twin towers in the banking district of Frankfurt have been modernised, and bankers have now been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the finance company apparently wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the & quot; Financial Times Deutschland & quot; writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
& quot; We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell real estate and then & quot; to rent back, "he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institution is relinquishing its registered office after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the Doppelstürme from the investors of an in-house fund for 272 million euros in mid-2007, and then lavishly renovated the double towers.
The energy conversion gobbled up approximately 200 million euros, according to the data.
Selling would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed & quot; Greentowers & quot;, at approximately 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is still open, said the spokesman.
Thousands mourn dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have paid tribute to the buried miners who were pronounced dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered, because the security situation in the shaft continues to be precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
Twenty-nine miners aged 17-62 were buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the crash shaft, but it had not found any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue teams were unable to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now, relatives and friends commemorated the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in glorious sunshine in Greymouth, South Island of New Zealand.
They fell silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up, showing helmets, lamps and the names of their friends.
Also pictures and personal effects, including clothes and surfboards, found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, flags were flown at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the & quot; miners from the depths of the earth & quot; would come back to the surface, Prime Minister John Key of New Zealand told the commemoration participants.
& quot; But they never came home. & quot;
He could not end in death until he saw his son's body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the ceremony.
Miners of British and South African origin were also buried in the first explosion on November 19.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases are displaced, they will begin cooling down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Hell, Warriors!
Does Splatter match Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries anew with his fighter-epic & quot; Walhalla Rising & quot;.
Which audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he shot & quot; Valhalla Rising & quot;?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and uses almost superhuman powers to kill his enemies in rows - sounds ideal for young male viewers seeking bloody action, especially because our hero likes to resort to brutal killing methods and tear his enemies' intestines out of their lives when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as it is actually called, does not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters at most allow themselves to be dragged away for a sentence or two, or a few agonizing cries of death.
Otherwise, people will be silent and will revel in the spookily beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which provides the scenery for the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
It's nice if a movie has several audiences, it' s only a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy & quot; Pusher & quot;, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor, or with a little less brutality to the art house.
Most art-cinema-fans will be put off by the splashing around of brains and intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest, when EinAugen sets sail for free interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity gets stuck in the doldrums and fog, before the team apparently arrives in America, where they remain silent.
No wonder that & quot; Valhalla Rising & quot; could not find a cinema distributor in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is a pity, especially because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping façade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it is all atmosphere, a feverish dream made into a film.
And there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn hardly allows him a moment of relaxation, slowly closing his throat with his icy images and the sinister trance-like soundtrack, but most of all with the incomprehensible hate that beats from the hearts of the characters.
Only a small blond boy, loyal to One Eye, retains something of innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes the warrior of hell for enemies and temporarily allies, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means spoilage, but perhaps only for the already spoiled ones.
& quot; Valhalla Rising & quot; is a puzzling film to hate and to admire, to anger, to excitement and to amazement.
An experience.
Puzzling earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow controls to take place.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I aircraft attacked a mysterious cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the closest major city, 30 km away, is Dair-as-Saur.
Her name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when referring to the reactor that Syria claims to have built with the help of North Korea in the block hidden in a valley off the stream.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence service CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, was well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
The technology from the fifties is hardly useful for other purposes.
The CIA performed a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
Using computer animation, she showed which components of the reactor, which is a miniaturized copy of the North Korean model from the nuclear center at Yongbyon, was supposed to have been destroyed.
She also provided photographs showing the building up close, or even the interior.
The reactor was on the verge of commissioning, it said, but had not yet been stocked with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little is known more than back then, in fact the puzzles got bigger over time.
Former President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, while the CIA was fairly certain prior to the attack that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, it saw little evidence that the country had an active nuclear weapons program.
Some intelligence operatives in Europe prefer to be even more cautious, speaking only of a & quot; alleged reactor, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be plausible.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied succinctly in the summer that the IAEA had 'enough material to ask questions'.
The Syrians hurriedly pulled aside the debris of the alleged & quot; unused military building, and thoroughly leveled the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team headed by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
Moreover, through a Member State, the IAEA received post-attack satellite images from commercial providers, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - Israel, perhaps - purchased them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it never conducted a secret nuclear programme or built a reactor.
The uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA dismissed that as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Damascus has refused to discuss the matter since then, as have the satellite images.
In addition, the inspectors are barred from conducting a second inspection in el-Kibar and from accessing the rubble of the bombed-out building.
But even Israel is steadfastly silent.
& quot; We will never comment on this, 'Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in power at the time of the attack, recently reiterated the official position.
So the investigation into the case has been dragging on inconclusively since June 2008, and & quot; is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency, as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits: after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in the offing of the IAEA.
The IAEA appears to view three other facilities that are supposed to be functionally connected to the suspected reactor - and still exist, unlike the one.
To date, the inspectors have not disclosed which installations they are, what their functions are, or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to at IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and, using satellite imagery, located a building complex near Masyaf, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately adjacent to a military base - precisely because of this reason, Syria will deny IAEA access to the three sites.
Vienna says Syrians fear a nuclear expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip-off from the US secret services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photos, that material was being transported between the three locations and the cuboid on the Euphrates River.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be 'quot; related to fuel production'.
However, there was no evidence of sensitive activities, such as uranium enrichment or reprocessing, that are necessary to build nuclear weapons.
Although the type of reactor is operated with non-enriched uranium.
But where the uranium should have come from, and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from, there are at best plausible guesses on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could have hidden valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to know where the debris has gone.
The IAEA considers the al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, an unlikely location for the repository of radioactive waste discovered by Syria in 1998.
She was recently linked to the reactor by former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley, in an analysis of satellite imagery for the respected magazine Jane & apos;'s Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria was carrying out earthworks at the three suspicious locations, removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This can be chance, but it has done little to dispel the suspicion.
Moreover, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, intended to allow Syria to maintain military secrecy - the sheer amount of effort demonstrated by the inspectors' interest.
However, Damascus also brushed off this suggestion.
While Western diplomats in Vienna appeased a year ago that the reactor had been destroyed, and that the matter was therefore not of high urgency, US Ambassador Glyn Davies, for example, has been using so-called special inspections, one of the toughest methods the Vienna Nuclear Administration has used to enforce inspections, for the past few months.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already talked about & quot; an option that I am open to in the future, but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this path: first, it requires a majority on the IAEA's Board of Governors, and quite a few of the 35 countries represented there are far from keen on an escalation.
Secondly, as one diplomat points out: 'What if they end up finding nothing at all?'
Love in Times of War
Trouble has ensued since Angelina Jolie began working on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut in the summer.
She wrote the screenplay herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serbian man.
There is not much more we do not know about this - but that already suffices for agitation.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosnian women's organisations immediately protested, and some days of shooting scheduled in Sarajevo were relocated to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but protests are still taking place in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female Victims of War wrote to Jolie through the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and requested a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is an ambassador of the UN Refugee Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they declined.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
There have never been love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended to the UN refugee agency that Jolie be dismissed as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for those scenes?
After some back and forth, the Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which read her script, granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she has no political intentions with her film, that she worked hard to become involved in the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and that she wants to give voice to all sides involved.
However, it remains vague on the content.
There is a second synopsis about the film circulating online, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other already before the war started, and they meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim girl, is kidnapped into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds quite different to the variant & quot; Rape Victim has a crush on Tortorknecht & quot;.
It is safe to say that Jolie's film actually started before the war.
Pressuring them, Jolie said, is' unfair 'and based on misinformation.
Now, it seems only the hackers of Hollywood can bring peace to it: by illegally posting the screenplay online, as they have done so many times before.
Nothing but away here
This evening, things are finally going well again for the Irish.
Not a trace of grief.
For this reason, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans cheer with joy at loud music, they stamp their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland, trembles as players throw ping pong balls over a three-metre distance into beer cups - and hit them.
& quot; Bierpong & quot; is the name of this bizarre spectacle. You can win a 500 Euro win award plus flight tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; that shrill drinking game and the low-key computer scientist, they don 't really go together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to enjoy himself, distracting himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play in Las Vegas, but he will be in New Zealand for job interviews in January.
& quot; I have a queasy feeling about & quot;, "he says.
& quot; It is so far away from home and yet I have no work there. & quot;
After all, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - & quot; she had her dream job as event manager, maybe a good sign & quot;, says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney while his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts at the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they expect as many as 200,000 emigrants.
This is a huge loss for the small country of only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of prosperity for the Irish, tristesse is on the rise again.
The economic crisis is especially unsettling the young, well-educated Irish, who have been on the road only uphill until now.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
But now three in 10 women and men under thirty are out of work.
The Irish Times is awash with letters from the editor of young emigrants lamenting: & quot; Everything goes down in Ireland. & quot;
& quot; There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can, go away and our country loses a whole generation. & quot;
& quot; The last one turns off the light. & quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Union of Students, sees a bleak future ahead because the government is' window-dressing 'and no longer offering young people any hope for the future.
& quot; They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs & quot;, says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students wriggle from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest worry, she says, is having to emigrate in four years.
& quot; This thought is sad and depressing. & quot;
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to fill the topic positively.
McLarnon is organizing the & quot; WorkingAbroadExpo & quot;, a trade show that provides a comprehensive service for working abroad.
& quot; For career starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take their first steps on the career ladder, says the manager.
On his web page photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not only a galley service, but also freedom and fun.
Seán O 'apos; Donovan has known for half a year what it feels like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29 year old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are currently pulling up a fashion store.
In January we will continue to Hannover or Berlin for our next project.
O & apos; Donovan now rarely sees his home, as he does extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
& quot; The situation is a bit crazy & quot;, "he says, stepping over the threshold of his house for the first time in a long while.
& quot; I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I am as good as never more. & quot;
He laughs a bit sheepishly and walks through cooled rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential neighborhood with well-tended front gardens, in the driveways large, expensive cars park.
With a sister, O 'apos; Donovan bought the house for 380,000 Euros four years ago - 100% loan-financed.
& quot; It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions & quot;, he says.
Is he afraid that credit might go wrong?
O & apos; Donovan ponders for a while, pouring hot tea and saying: & quot; I have no children to feed through and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over again. & quot;
The civil engineer does not like the wailing, which he often hears at the moment.
& quot; Nobody has to go hungry - our situation is nowhere near as dramatic as in former times here on & quot;, "he says.
& quot; Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish in the first place. & quot;
He laughs and then talks about his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
& quot; After seven years, he was back and life continued in Ireland, quite simply. & quot;
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and let's see how life is going elsewhere.
He has already had a few years of work in London, and why should things not work well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that really worries him these days: the celebration of his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He is afraid that it might degenerate into a farewell party.
& quot; Just not too many emotions & quot;, he says, taking a big sip of his beer.
& quot; Farewell, it sounds scary. & quot;
& quot; Let's call it a go-away, casual, with some friends, some drinks, some games. & quot;
The Demoatric Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is gaining strength, as is support for private enterprises.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, the influence of Brazil is greater than that of the United States.
These are the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, thus showing the change of opinion in this region.
There are two facts that catch the eye of & apos;'s respondents in this year' s September and October Poll.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its major institutions.
In numerous countries along the South American Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown at an annual rate of 6% since 2002, pro-democracy support increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy is recovering from last year's sharp decline.
Yet only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are staunch Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practices, the same number as last year but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Some 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% trust their government. Both values are the same as last year but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts to become more democratic.
This continued during the Great Depression, possibly because the countries of Latin America experienced only a short period of recession, and recovered quickly.
Moreover, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social safety net.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009, and fell by 32% again this year.)
However, there are strong differences in sentiment from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy, and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more pronounced and violent crime increased.
For only the second time since the start of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member became a victim of a crime last year, but compared to 38% last year, the levels have decreased, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic performance is reflected in increased support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents nationwide reported that the private sector is indispensable for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, up from 47% last year.
Interestingly enough, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of private sector ownership), despite the fact that its leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil has the most weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
By contrast, respondents in Mexico and most of Central America see the US as the most influential country, with Venezuela taking over the role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An Electoral Slap
Nobody expected the November 28th elections in Haiti to be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election workers who rushed to the aid of the stricken country.
Crowded ballot boxes, ballot boxes filled with ballot boxes, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only some of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom were made homeless by the January earthquake, roamed the streets looking for a choice.
Some eventually gave up completely.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected front-runners, requested that the results of the election be annulled due to alleged fraud.
Protests, some of them violent, have taken place across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the chief of staff of the UN Mission in Haiti, described the election as' fairly good in many respects'.
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily render the process invalid.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, supposedly beholden to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate Jude Celestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The expected runoff is scheduled for Jan.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claim.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is declared the winner of the runoff by the electoral commission, this could cause problems.
The low turnout was feared due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million earthquake victims are still living in tents.
On Election Day, a lack of organization prevented many Haitians from casting their ballots.
Shortly before the start of the election, approximately 250,000 passes needed to vote had not yet been issued.
The stakes are high.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government to be an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Stealth Into the Middle
In the weeks following her husband's sudden death, Argentina' s President Cristina Fernández received a wave of sympathy, driving her approval rating up 20 points to over 50%, its highest since she was elected in 2007.
But whether that helps her win re-election next year depends on whether visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The characters for this are not unique.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to direct economic policy after his wife was elected, frequently drew up budgets that did not take full account of tax receipts, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra income as they chose.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the congressional majority last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further clashes.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists sided with Cristina Fernández.
But, after chaotic sessions (in which one lawmaker punched another in the face while others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
& quot; I am not going to discuss & quot;,'she said.
The 2010 budget now applies to next year, giving the President even more scope to spend as she sees fit.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
Official inflation currently stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates - and trade union wage claims - are pushing it closer to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was rocked by economic crises, declared growth and poverty eradication as his main goals, not inflation reduction.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullied the private sector, and cleansed the National Institute of Statistics and Census, INDEC, which subsequently beautified the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
She has called on the private sector and union leaders for talks.
And officials say they plan to cap pay increases at 18% next year.
High world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a big boost.
But inflation undercut the growth momentum by a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps this is why Cristina Fernández wants to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government struck a deal with security holders who had rejected the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández appears to be pushing for a deal with the backers of the Paris Club, to whom she is owed approximately $6.7bn.
The Kirchners had always refused IMF scrutiny, as is the custom elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide technical assistance for the creation of a new national consumer price index. It appears that this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will continue to be politically active after her term of office ends, even without the assistance of her husband.
If so, it will need the support of the middle class, much of which has had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy shown to them will have ebbed away.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly annul many of her husband's policy decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly moving closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait?
On November 27th, more than 7.5 million voters, 70% of all eligible voters, headed to the five boroughs to elect mayors and city councillors. This is considered to be a broad rating by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a token figure for mainland relations. His policies have transformed mainland China relationship for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, it did not gain a majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which favors greater independence for Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45% of the vote.
In a presidential election, that would have meant trouble for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined forces with the KMT to become councillors.
During the election, there were the usual occurrences in Taiwan, such as truck convoys of rioters, mass flag-waving parades, and scantily clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, addressed a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the gunman wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Separately, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack marred the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, resulting in more votes for the KMT.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, there was no mention of relations with the mainland.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to prioritise its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP avoided stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment too much.
It was responding to a new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
For his part, Ma would like to confirm that the majority of the Taiwanese support his policy on China.
The government in Beijing will continue its strategy of luring Taiwan back to the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly it wishes to be politically integrated, but the most important thing is first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has now reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened: former Party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of moderate politicians emerged, and the DPP is fighting for the voices of working people and young people.
Tsai was widely approved as the DPP's presidential candidate, as Su Tseng-chang was under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that it too can build close relations with Beijing.
Tsai plans to set up an think tank as a contact point between the DPP and China. This, however, requires unbiased discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a & quot; trustworthy alternative to Ma's rash rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
Speaking from his cell, he said DPP candidates had done better insisting on Taiwan's independence.
He even told pragmatist Su to refrain from running for president.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP has a hard time choosing its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's ratings are poor, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-widening gap between rich and poor.
A spokesman for the KMT said it would be reshaping its cabinet as well as local facilities.
The strong stance taken by the DPP suggests that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, there is already no turning back.
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly named Newcomer of the Year
When you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to appear at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now, surprisingly, the jazz bassist and singer, 26, has been nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star on the jazz scene since her album, & quot; Esperanza & quot; 2008, the nomination seems somewhat unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules that an artist may release no more than three albums before the album with which he or she became known to the general public is released.
Her ambitious 2010 album, & quot; Chamber Music Society & quot;, is certainly a step forward. And with her exhilarating voice and a keen sense of pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can easily be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category came closest to Spalding's nomination.
Furthermore, the Vijay Iyer Trio's album & quot; Historicity & quot; was nominated in the Instrumental Album category. This critic' s favourite was a huge success as a result.
Iyers' competitors include & quot; Moody 4B & quot; by experienced saxophonist James Moody and & quot; Positootly & quot; by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a heavy favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's & quot; Treme & quot;, was recognized in the Contemporary Jazz category, which usually includes albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ by the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the large group category. He now goes up against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his Kammer-Jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his Octet, whose Life-Ablum & quot; Pathways & quot; is a good example of a bass player as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music categories
The Classical Music nominations for the 53rd Grammy Awards feature a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list is topped by Michael Daugherty's & quot; Deux Ex Machina & quot; for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackeys & quot; Dreamhouse & quot;, an eclectic orchestral work with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 & quot; Los Angeles & quot;. This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman has also been nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical music nominations are divided into 13 categories, ranging from orchestral, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot; and & quot; Metropolis Symphony & quot; performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys & quot; Dreamhouse & quot; by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; & quot; Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati & quot; performed by various artists
In the Opera category, Bergs & quot; Lulu were selected by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses & quot; Marc Antonio e Cleopatra & quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos & quot; L & apos; Amour de Loin & quot; by the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot; by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans & quot; Ivanhoe &
Composers nominated include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot;, Hans Werner Henze for & quot; Appassionatamente Plus & quot;, Magnus Lindberg for & quot; Graffiti & quot; and Shchedrin for & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot;.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 received its world premiere on January 4th at Disney Hall, where it was recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is titled & quot; Los Angeles & quot; and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dormans & quot; Mondoline Concerto & quot; received a nomination in the Instrumental Solo with Orchestra category.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
& quot; I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms, & quot;, Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchestral Performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's work with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Instrumental soloists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson have been nominated.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording & quot; Roots - My Life, My Song & quot;.
Temecula mosque wins planning committee approval
The construction of a mosque in Temecula was unanimously approved by the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new Religious Centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eyecatcher.
& quot; The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others & quot; said Hadi Nael, Chairman of Temecula Valley Islamic Center on Thursday morning.
& quot; Being American, That Makes Me Proud. & quot;
& quot; It shows that justice reigns. & quot;
& quot; There are few enemies in & quot;, 'he added.
& quot; They are just very loud. & quot;
& quot; Wonderful people live in this valley. & quot;
The session started at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center continued almost until midnight, with the votes from both sides fairly evenly distributed according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
& quot; There is no more America & quot;,'read one comment.
& quot; Another Planet of the Apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand. & quot;
& quot; America is at the end. & quot;
Planned Islamic centers have led to protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the terrorist attacks on the city of New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for many years, but they wanted a bigger and better place than the one they rented with a water filtration manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 large Mediterranean-style mosque is to have two minarets and become approximately 13 meters high.
It will be built on the approximately 17,500 m2 of land at Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the city council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could pave way for new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria that can live on arsenic opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered essential to life.
& quot; This organism has two possibilities. & quot;
& quot; He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow. & quot;
& quot; This makes it something very special, even though it is almost a kind of & apos; alien & apos; way of life, said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday.
To date, six main elements have been considered essential for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur.
But, as the scientists discovered, the bacterium continues to grow in Mono Lake, California, even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
& quot; It makes you wonder what else is possible,'said the report' s co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, Anbar said.
The study deals with microbes that have been found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details of the discovery were announced, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can start biochemical processes with the help of other elements, and that the & apos; standard elements, which we believe are absolutely essential for life, are not necessarily pre-defined & quot;, explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
& quot; This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another, & quot; added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute of NASA, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
As arsenic and phosphorus chemically resemble each other, she assumed that microbes exposed to both might be able to replace one element with another.
& quot; The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus. & quot;
& quot; This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other. & quot;
& quot; But the difference is so great that arsenic has a different effect to phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears just about everything. & quot; explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
While the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Lecturer in Microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea of replacing phosphorus with arsenic is nothing new, but there's no working example yet.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so's why scientists believe early life forms used it.
& quot; This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from the Early Earth Age, said & quot;'s Forster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
Research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Remaining stolen show dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four dogs stolen from outside a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared Tuesday when unidentified people stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van the animals were in outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were discovered Wednesday night, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
& quot; The good news is that the dogs are doing well & quot;, according to Whitmore.
& quot; They are in good condition. & quot;
& quot; They have been returned to their rightful owners. & quot;
Whitmore did not give details about where the dogs were found, or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
& quot; Investigations are ongoing. & quot;
& quot; We do n 't want to say any more about this, explains Whitmore.
& quot; We Trace Some Traces. & quot;
The dog's owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unavailable for comment on Thursday.
They picked up their two dogs at a Downey County Animal Shelter on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3 year old male, and Didi, a 10 month old female - were according to the authorities statement unhurt.
But the corgis Bunny and Peter, who wanted to introduce Rickard and Peek to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was scheduled to compete.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - with them to their motel room.
The thick-backed Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They kept the window open one slit so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6: 00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder reward to anyone who could give a hint about the corgis. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
It was not clear Thursday whether a finder's salary will be paid.
The lion roars again after court approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to make a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially approved the & quot; creditors' plan to pay down $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to launch new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's testimony, the plan meets the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so nothing stands in the way of the MGM reboot headed by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will co-manage the slightly pared down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually become effective only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a proposed $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself is raising $75 million, is headed the company. Financing is expected to be done by mid-December.
The reorganization of the studio began in May 2009 with the assignment to the investment bank Moelis & amp; Co., to help the management of the company, which was struggling with interest payments of $300m / year, to solve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & amp; Cooper's efforts to solve MGM' s financial woes and pay off the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders, and none wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by creditors.
It all started all over again in the spring of this year, when the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October after months of debate and internal disputes.
When MGM is officially out of bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & amp; Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 per month to run the company, will receive a & quot; Success Bonus of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film, and prepared an annual schedule of seven or eight films scheduled to hit theaters in early 2012.
They are also planning two films based on & quot; The Little Hobbit in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio is seeking a separate $265 million to $275 million bond for its financial stake in the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, which is its largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not yield any results.
Tech keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gizmos can tear a sizable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX bikes for $99, while the price of a Kinect game is approximately 10 classic skipping ropes, or approximately 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys & quot; R & quot; Us and a BJ & apos; s Wholesale Club, in search of three electronics toys under $80.
I realized immediately that Moore's law went into effect. This year, the technology toys will be more powerful, while costing slightly less than last year.
And while fewer new webside toys are coming out, the best known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, are offering a wider range.
More and more coin cell powered toys are hitting the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices are from Toys & quot; R & quot; Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children ages 3 and over) are plush toys as large as guinea pigs that sing a note when you press their belly.
Pressing a button once is equivalent to a note, while pressing it several times can be used to play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: once you start pressing, you will not be able to stop pressing.
For a combination of singing and dancing, the best choice is the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children aged 2 and over).
Using Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interactive games such as & apos; Simon says & apos;, and dominates the Moon Walk thanks to its innovative hinged feet with wheel blocking.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as their dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now it is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children 3 years and older), with a whole pile of question cards to turn a drive-by-car trip into a lesson, with a knowledgeable teacher with an auto-correction function.
If you don 't want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children 3-8 years old) is the cheapest and most user friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3-12), which has a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major reworking of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3-7 years old) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and ebooks, and thanks to its SD card drive you can even view family photos on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for kids 8 +). The five blocks are no bigger than a match box, and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting blocks together to form words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spell contest.
More and more toys are having some kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone, the most important ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2 & quot; Mix & apos; N Match Pack ($5 for kids 6-12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
By entering the Code Online, your Child will receive sufficient credits for two additional parts at the Club Penguin Store.
This can be a roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest headache-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children aged 5 and over) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
Sending him through a maze of blocks is fun.
And he endures quite a bit.
Ours fell off the kitchen table, and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China getting gentler
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin paced around a city square, checking his nervous subordinates and issuing orders with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's rugged guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their indiscriminate raids and penchant for violence - to impress the audience.
& quot; Standing Straight! & quot;
& quot; Looking Straight ahead!
& quot; Show them & quot;, he whispered to them, & quot; how pretty girls are! & quot;
Four girls, barely out of their teenage years, stood tight, wearing white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on top of the hair, which was streaked with blue-and-white bows.
& quot; To me they look average & quot;, Mr. Tang notes dismissively.
& quot; models are pretty. & quot;
Several governments have tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray-green uniform.
Wuhan, Central China, replaced violence with staring: In 2009, 50 officers reportedly circled an improperly positioned takeaway truck and stared at the operator until he wrapped up and left the place half an hour later.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to radically change its image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been reinforcing the police patrols of the city. They have been specially selected for their appearance, good shape, and youth.
They are meant to give a softer, feminine aspect to the rough-and-tumble police force.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would struggle to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Quite, say the critics.
Unlike police, these officers can only enforce city laws through fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely portrays a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat a spectator to death while he filmed them using his mobile phone to crush a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a Beijing police training manual describing how to beat criminals without bloodshed was stolen and published on the Internet.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials.
A violent video game, which can be downloaded from the Internet, shows officers trained in China attacking street dealers.
& quot; Chengguan frightens the government & quot; lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversies over the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a really thorough & quot; clean up & quot;.
Skeptics find the current approach significantly inadequate.
When the district advertised eight female recruits in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women were real-world assignments or intended only as visual distractions.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18-22 with good physiques and & quot; harmonious facial features were sought.
They should be above average in size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 ½ in.
Employment ends when person is 26 years of age.
Working for women over 25 is too physically demanding, according to officials.
& quot; The most important thing is their image & quot;, said an unnamed district official at the quasi-governmental website Rednet. com. com.
& quot; Whether the female candidates get the job depends first of all on their appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc. & quot;
Then come temperament and & quot; internal qualities & quot;.
& quot; Females Chengguan are like vases of flowers & quot;, 'he said, adding that' quot; but in addition they have other duties & quot;.
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, does not wish to agree with this description,
, admitted that sizing in job advertisements for both genders is not uncommon in China.
The same applies to uniform features.
Whether this equals good looks is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
& quot; Unfortunately, we cannot use Lame or Humpback here, & quot;, according to Mr. Zheng.
& quot; Your Image Would Not Be Good. & quot;
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn 't feel sexist about paying so much attention to her looks.
& quot; Do you think I look sexy in this uniform? & quot; asks her with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, 'We are here to represent the image of the city. & quot;
They say they have no regrets about the short-term hiring, saying they have more ambitious career plans than simply chasing traders around the streets to stop them doing business.
Every morning, the police force deals with around twelve street vendors who, on foot or by bicycle, try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible, before being chased away.
& quot; Mr. Wang, please disappear here. & quot;
& quot; We have told you this so many times! & quot; explains Miss Xu to a trader who fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen, which was mounted on a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the job is more monotonous than exhausting.
& quot; It's almost every day the same & quot; explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies Distribution in her spare time.
& quot; Everything Routine. & quot;
One reason for this is that female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of traders, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten offenders to report them to their male superior.
This is to protect them from the public hostility that civil servants in China are often subjected to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, went on a rampage after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen policemen and Chenguan officials were injured in the overnight incident, with 14 government vehicles overturned or set alight.
Xindu has so far avoided such acts of violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the tranquil Baonguang Square where the female officers patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered at one street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired, contrary to regulations, on the sidewalk instead of in a repair shop.
The owner screamed Ceasefire and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the grim-faced officers made their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind, flipping over his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
& quot; Sometimes we proceed verbally. & quot;
& quot; Sometimes also physically & quot;, explains Mr. Li soberly.
& quot; Most of the time people start arguing. & quot;
Prosecutor will not indict Senator Ensign
Prosecutors from the Justice Department have acquitted Senator John Ensign of charges stemming from his affair with a former campaign aide and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's attorneys announced Wednesday.
This decision brings to an end the most serious allegation against Senator Ensign, the Nevada Republican. Until the scandal made national headlines and dampened his career, he was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
Senator Ensign's office announced that it was pleased with the verdict after a year-long investigation.
The Senate Ethics Committee, however, could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's attorneys, they have been notified by the Department of Justice that the investigation into Senator Ensign has been terminated and that no further charges have been filed in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there was ample evidence Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first revealed in the New York Times in October 2009, gave rise to speculation that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his campaign aides, win lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hamptons wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Ensign's treasurer during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he lobbied Hamptons for her after she was hired.
Because Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called revolving door lobbying ban.
According to the published circumstantial evidence, & quot; appears to be collusion and violation of the revolving door bylaws, 'according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients targeted by the government.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the department seemed very cautious about accepting political charges after a series of defeats that were followed by the media with great interest, including the decision last year to drop charges of misconduct by the prosecutor against former Senator Ted Stevens.
Prosecutors are obviously terrible & quot;, said Melanie Sloan, president of & quot; Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington & quot; (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers that brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to court.
& quot; This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the law does not apply to them, & quot; she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, informing him that the department would not bring charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had worked with prosecutors to convince them that the senator acted in accordance with the law, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday.
Mr. Coggins declined to elaborate on the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
& quot; I am not comfortable going into the details of the talks between the Department of Justice and myself. That being said, we think we made the right decision & quot;, "he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to close its investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group alleging that a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything more than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbying work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
A December 2008 e-mail records that after the company brought Mr. Hampton forward as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, informing him that he was knocking on the Interior Department' s door for a matter.
Mr. Ensign also had lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after it hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When information about the affair first came to light last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican pecking order.
After not being seen for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police investigations, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the Ethics Committee would quickly follow the Justice Department 'example and close its investigation.
& quot; Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work serving the people of Nevada & quot;, she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent out their reports of gruesome testimonies on Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 tweets about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will officially come to an end when the sentence of death pronounced by the jury is passed down by the judge.
But Mr. Hayes' attorneys have already filed motions with the court, laying out grounds for an appeal and that will occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intense coverage of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by the average reporter - created a circus atmosphere and a pervasive, immediate penetration of inflammatory detail, such that the jury was unduly influenced by the public outrage.
This objection could prompt the appellate courts to consider whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
& quot; As I experienced during this trial, I truly believe that there is a danger in allowing the new technologies to enter the courtroom to affect the right of every individual to a fair trial,'said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead plaintiff.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court, flatly rejected the requests last week when he said that the new media would be carefully controlled & quot; and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that certainly was not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court filings have found that covering notorious cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court annulled the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who was alleged to have killed his wife, and stated in his decision that there was a 'quot; carnival atmosphere in the & quot; courtroom due to the new media.
Some people believe that the TV series and the feature film & quot; On the Run & quot; is based on this crime.
Some attorneys say that court filings, which look at Mr. Hayes' sentence half a century later, may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication out of the courtroom, which were unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
& quot; There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in lawsuits followed by the general public, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be fascinated by the idea that restricting instant communication from within the courtroom might make the trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many being put forward by Mr. Hayes' lawyers for years to come, delaying a conviction.
Defense attorneys also contend, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test potential jurors' reactions by showing them grisly crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, filled them with revulsion.
Defense attorneys say they also question the constitutionality of the death penalty, arguing that the judge erroneously replaced a juror who was a critic of the prosecution, and that he unduly pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to vacate the jury over the weekend.
Jurors were not isolated.
But her arguments about the influence of in-depth coverage of the trial may attract the greatest interest.
In a judgment challenge filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut, and that it was discussed by candidates during the campaign for Governor of California and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the new media has continually rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
& quot; The lawyers wrote, & quot; This kind of daily crush of media beeps, cameras and reporters outside of the courtroom has never been seen before in New Haven, and maybe even nationally. & quot;
Her emphasis on Twitter's reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that claiming that these direct messages are more inflammatory than reports that are reported more slowly is an anti-technology stunt that impoverishes reporting on future trials.
But some attorneys said appeals courts often face arguments that societal and technological change needs to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's attorneys back up that claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction for reporting, and made clear that the new media require new rules.
& quot; This case & quot;, they wrote, & quot; represents Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century. & quot;
Can courtesy connect the divider?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Is this the omen of genuine two-party cooperation, or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the fighting of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders failed to produce a breakthrough on major issues to be dealt with during the so-called' lame duck session '.
By all accounts, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a consideration of their shared responsibilities to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan point-scoring.
The president's deficit commission's public meeting Wednesday was equally civilized, despite the policy differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological chasm that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to say that a new era of cooperation has dawned.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one asks for the other to show signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after another bout of partisan warfare.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting itself and its assessment by the attendees was limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the last two years.
Whether it is taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election softened Washington's mood, at least for a short period of time.
& quot; No question, the tone has changed & quot;, said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for & quot; Ethics and Public Policy Center.
& quot; This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions that die again.
And that's a good thing.
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of & quot; lame duck session & quot;, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. & quot;
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and nobody advocates them.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or all of them, temporary or permanent.
Similarly, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because the Republicans cannot afford to believe that they are favoring tax cuts for the rich while denying assistance to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there has been a growing optimism that these issues can be agreed upon during the & quot; lame duck session & quot;, while also ratifying the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of lame duck session & quot; need not necessarily lead to enduring cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
& quot; After the things that need to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation & quot;, "he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
& quot; I see much that happens from now until 2012, as a pre-match, or shadow-boxing, for the main event of 2012 & quot;, 'he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the make-up of the new Republican majority in the White House, and with the tea party voters who were instrumental in their formation.
As concerned as Republican leaders may be about playing too much poker, they know they have to try to deliver on their promises to cut government spending and repeal health care reform.
These party lines are already apparent in the initial reactions regarding the deficit commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and reducing government expenditure.
Vice Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington, and have, by their own estimation, pushed the deficit issue so hard into the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation, and they are fighting hard to get anywhere near that number.
The greatest opposition is found in the elected representatives of the body, because on financial issues, at least now, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take the form of party clashes next year, when Republicans will challenge Obama over the state's budget, taxes, and health-care system, followed later by a period of more bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, both parties must be careful about the public reaction.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and seek compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and appear to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the congressional Republicans than was once between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a much more consequential election in 2012.
Seen this way, the civility displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still divide the two.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven for corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of the & quot; kleptocracy & quot; and it passes part of the bribes and protection money it collects on to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the state security service, it is said, extort large sums of protection money to enable them to maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the & quot; vertical of authority & quot; - takes its share of the money that moves up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on WikiLeaks' homepage on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow Mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence to suggest he was fired in the interim.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous defamation suits against such allegations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian television station: 'It' s crazy, it's dirty, it' s dirty. & quot;
An incredible number of Russians believe their society is corrupt, surveys have shown.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are named, and it is unheard of for this to happen through a diplomat of a foreign country.
& quot; The Moscow government's direct connection to crime has led some to call it a' quot; disturbed & quot; and come to the conclusion that the government acts more like a kleptocrat than a 'quot; government', according to the memo.
& quot; Criminal elements enjoy a & quot; kryshna & quot; (term from the criminal / Mafia world, which literally means & quot; roof & quot; or protection) which extends to the police, State security (FSB), the intelligence agency (MVD) and the prosecutor's office as well as to the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
& quot; Luzhkov comes first. & quot;
& quot; FSB, MVD and militia are on the second level. & quot;
& quot; The lowest level is followed by the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors. & quot;
& quot; This is an incompetent system where criminal groups close a loophole in some areas because the city does not offer any help. & quot;
The report goes on to say that the FSB is collecting money from the largest companies, and that the police are arresting small businessmen.
A source, it is, & quot; explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not organized crime), because not only do they have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law. & quot;
& quot; This is the reason why protection by criminal gangs is no longer as popular as it used to be. & quot;
The memo notes that while raising funds is comprehensive, the protections themselves will be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find themselves closed very quickly - for one reason or another.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption, but he has also noted that he has made little headway.
The memo from the embassy contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
& quot; Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats to fight corruption, Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow-based group of experts, said in a recent interview.
& quot; But it is part of this bureaucracy. & quot;
& quot; It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia. & quot;
Without a politician, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Countrywide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries ranked least corrupt by & quot; to & quot; most corrupt & quot;).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy memo, which occurred late this evening, according to Moscow time, is certain to generate displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that it' s solving the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be forgery, and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
& quot; The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic politics in this country & quot;, "he said.
& quot; But to be honest, we didn 't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such an unethical way, you know. & quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom with dirty and flaking walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, Ta Mok, later to become Khmer Rouge leader.
& quot; Everyone here loves Ta Mok. & quot;
& quot; He was a good leader and he looked after his people & quot; said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Known as & quot; the Butcher & quot; due to its brutality during the Khmer Rouge domination, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrender to the government, longtime followers in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a joint UN-Cambodian tribunal sentenced a former Khmer Rouge member for the first time, when it sentenced the former chief of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among Alnlong Veng's Khmer Rouge veterans, complicating their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
& quot; There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything & quot; said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization researching the regime.
& quot; For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. & quot;
& quot; It splits families. & quot;
During Khmer Rouge's rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-ed government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Here they spread trouble until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary fought guerrilla war from their bases in the West of the Cambodian Mountains and Jungle, Ta Mok brought up the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge militants began defecting to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who refused to yield, was arrested by government forces in the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh Prison, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the grinding poverty of rural Cambodia, and many held nostalgic memories of the movement.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials retained local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the rank-and-file soldiers remained poor, illiterate peasants.
& quot; These people have benefited very little from capitulation, said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
& quot; They are embedded in the regime's utopian agraridology. & quot;
& quot; They grew up without any professional knowledge. & quot;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
& quot; Life under the Khmer Rouge was good & quot;, he said.
& quot; Ta Mok gave something to eat to everyone. & quot;
& quot; But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves. & quot;
The ongoing Khmer Rouge tribunal has raised concerns here as well.
Early next year, the court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The mandate of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will prosecute any more than these four cases.
This has done little to ease the anxieties in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who served as Manteay district chief during Khmer Rouge's rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told Cambodian officials at the Documentation Center that she oversaw the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers are believed to have died.
One hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working the fields to her timber house on a filthy street outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss their Khmer Rouge past.
If the court summonses her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
& quot; Cambodia lives in peace and stability & quot;, she said.
& quot; If there were no more prosecutions, there would be war. & quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become volatile if the court indicted more suspects, despite what experts and historians are saying.
& quot; Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past & quot;, he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
& quot; reconciliation with the Khmer times means putting together the broken pieces & quot;, he said.
& quot; It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand like everything. & quot;
The Center created the first government-approved Khmer Rouge textbook, & quot; The History of Democratic Cambodia & quot;.
It distributed the book in Anlong Veng in June as an appendix to the Ministry of Education's High School History Book, which contains less than four pages about Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, despite the city's links to the regime, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents were skeptical when he took home the book to read.
& quot; My family reject many portions of the book and the court & quot;, 'he said.
& quot; They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court. & quot;
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are gradually gaining & quot; influence, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful pull here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, a path littered with shrubbery and plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned on a pile of tyres here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a street mobile phone saleswoman, said she did not know much about the man who had been burned here.
& quot; But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray & quot;,'she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later that day she wanted to go to Pol Pot' s final resting place, where she would drop a bush of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to cease weapons-grade uranium accumulation
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's meeting with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional Security Summit article.
The U.S. government had spent years trying to persuade Belarus to stop gathering highly enriched uranium, and seemed to hit a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told The Washington Post that two secret deals were struck with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarus research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the remainder of the footage - around £500, according to an official who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject.
The deal appears to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation & quot; nuclear security summit held in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the next Summit in 2012.
& quot; I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012). & quot;
& quot; This proves to me that it works & quot;, "said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group working to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement & quot; a very significant, important step & quot; by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
& quot; How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium & quot;, Lukashenko said at the time.
& quot; This is our raw material... We will not make any dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell & quot; to anyone.
& quot; We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all & quot;.
Belarus nevertheless came close to the US a few months ago when it expressed an interest in striking an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly radiographed, officials say.
It was loaded onto a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday, and according to officials, it was made by plane.
The US government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money going to Belarus' low-enriched uranium research, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
& quot; This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust & quot; led to the agreement that was signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on Global Hazard Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dismantle its warehouse by 2012, according to the joint agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the USA have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
& quot; Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a pivotal issue in improving bilateral relations and is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens. & quot; explains.
No objection from Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to CIA flights of Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram sent by the U.S. Ambassador in Madrid.
This is reflected in documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper & quot; El País & quot; (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish government be informed that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being adequately supervised. & quot;
In June 2006, after the publication of a report from the Council of Europe denouncing complicity in human rights violations in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre discussed with Fernández de la Vega.
The Deputy Prime Minister admitted that the council 'quot; report had hit Zapatero in the side, and reiterated that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
& quot; De la Vega emphasized that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory. & quot;
& quot; You just want to be informed & quot; so as not to catch & quot; unawares & quot;, Aguirre reports by cable.
The former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also informed the Ambassador that the Spanish government did not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little leverage because it is in the hands of the judges. & quot;
For his part, the Prosecutor Vicente González indicated to the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense concerning the CIA flights.
& quot; These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information, & quot; said the Ambassador after meeting with the Prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
& quot; This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discredit inter-governmental dealings, & quot; complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007 attended by the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that & quot; although the Spanish judges are insanely attached to their independence and do what they deem appropriate & quot;, he instructed his staff to avoid & quot; inflated rhetorical commentary to ease the tension. & quot;
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's handling of this matter.
& quot; Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience tells us that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on an indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or willfully ignored US actions that could be construed as potential human rights violations, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government & quot; he points out.
The infanticide worker admits she complained on the internet about the & quot; toil & quot; of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when the child was already dead, and she had a blog: Galician-style & quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is in Internet & quot; Muki & quot;.
By this nickname, which she keeps from a very young age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The messages are from 2008.
To understand them, one has to know their love lives, which the daily ABC reconstructs based on the testimony of their family members.
A Galician woman of 30 years, she began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she ended her relationship, it was revealed she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his wife never let him do a DNA analysis.
Soon after, she entered into another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages it can be inferred that their romance broke down and they parted ways.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca writing: & quot; Alberto is very strange and angry because I came for work. & quot;
& quot; When I told him about it, he liked it well, but now of course he knows what it means to be alone with the boy all day long, not to be free to do whatever he wants. & quot;
Later, she mentions a message she has just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the boy to." & quot;
She complains: 'If he doesn' t like me leaving the boy at my mum ', I'll pick him up when I' ll be back. & quot;
In May she talks about returning to her village: 'I'll go there this week, but I' ll only stay there until the 19th because I have to imagine myself working on the 20th if I don 't want to lose it. & quot;
She explains that she will take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
& quot; He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with anyone but my mother, & quot; a dubious intention considering their bad relationship.
There will be another mail in July.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month, and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
& quot; On the one hand, César is pleased, on the other hand, it is not. & quot;
& quot; On the one hand, he is with me and likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day. & quot;
She talks about moving to Mallorca.
& quot; There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I will have less expenditure on the nanny. & quot;
On the 17th: reminders and complaints.
& quot; A giant kiss from César, asking when you come. & quot;
& quot; Alberto says he has emailed me some videos. You see, if he wants to, he can find me, such a crap. & quot;
On the 30th another one: & quot; The boy is well. He is going to a summer course to learn Catalan. & quot;
There is a: & quot; He shoots money at me. & quot; Of Víctor, her current partner, there is one: & quot; He shoots money at me. & quot;
There are messages from her on the Internet, in anime and manga logs.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, now locked down, where she called herself & quot; Muki, the jailbird & quot;.
& quot; Terror a la gallega (title)
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting warden, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can't believe it all happened because she didn 't tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners of Justice in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the course of events, & quot;, and that she had no intention of causing harm to the little one.
However, she previously confessed to drowning César in the bath and stuffing his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28th November, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MEPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already looking ahead to the parliamentary elections, early or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party gets in these elections is usually twice as high as in the elections in Catalonia.
The Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, compared to 316,222 in the regional elections held in 2006.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this ascending trend - result of PSC vote redirection and PP electorate retention - continues, PP analysts predict that in the general election, the PPC could increase from 8 to 12 Congressmen, while CiU would gain 4 (it now has 10), and the PSC would lose at least 9 (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for the PP and the PSOE.
According to the Popular Party analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could keep its MP or gain one more.
However, if the electoral calendar is retained, the next date for municipal elections will be May 2011. Even then, the Popular Party (PP) may be the tongue in cheek to put an end to socialist domination, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the city council of Barcelona, one of the municipalities with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists cannot win a majority, nor fall back on their traditional allies (the ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not crazy that this party will lose its representation in the municipal council of Barcelona, in which it would have to gain 5% of the vote.
However, the PP has increased its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are convinced they can play the main role in Tarragona's turnaround, where they had governed together with the PP before the current mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, enjoys good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
In other major cities, such as Badalona, Castellde or Reus, the Popular Party has seen significant gains.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipalities of Catalonia, and aims to create lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell supplied Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona police were part of the Thai-controlled jihadist cell that supplied passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the Tamil Eelam Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam & quot; (LTTE) and Lashkar-e-Taiba & quot; (Let), the latter behind the bombings in Mumbai that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Spanish Interior Minister attributes great importance to these investigations, to the point that he asserts that & quot; has weakened the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda's worldwide operation, & quot;, thus weakening & quot;' s ability to act '.
The researchers estimate that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged, then forged and sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al Qaeda so that their & quot; fighters could & quot; cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The cell uncovered is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. That is why, in addition to the Thai investigators, other European police units have been involved in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that there will be attacks similar to the one carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday in the next few days.
In coordination with this operation (arresting Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was conducted in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung were arrested.
They had headed the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - stole passports from tourists in accordance with the instructions of the so-called & quot; International Islamic Front & quot;.
This means that the documents had to be issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 years and still be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
Investigators stress that no link has yet been established between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, despite the fact that the author of the attack was & quot; Lashkar e-Taiba & quot;, one of the groups of people receiving passports stolen in Spain and subsequently falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it is worth recalling that a few days before the assassination attempt, several thousand dollars had been sent from Catalonia by means of a money transfer company, invested in purchasing prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the & quot; command team, which put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police seized extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone tax deal
Yesterday, the leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to personally present to Artur Mas her conditions in support of his appointment as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These do not differ from those put during the campaign, and can be summed up by the primacy of economic recovery and the refrain from regionalist adventures in independence, such as the financial compensation agreement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party approached Artur Mas with the assurance that she would be granted the 18 deputies she won last Sunday - a figure more than enough to make her feel indispensable, because the candidate of the bourgeois regionalist CiU party depends on at least one opposition party abstaining from voting on his inauguration.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently conducting with the other party chiefs focus on Catalonia.
As for the leader of the PPC, she demands that in order to support & quot;'s accession to power, all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia, & quot; and an agreement on financial settlement between the State and the Autonomous Region - as in the Basque Country - and which the party leader of the CiU even wants to put to a referendum, should be put on the back burner.
What both leaders have in common is a desire to streamline the bureaucratic political machinery of the regional administration and abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
The details of the negotiations on the arrival of Mas are being examined by PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The Elderly Care Home confirms that the deaths were not caused by lack of action
Owners of Olot nursing home do not rule out that their keeper killed over 11 elderly people
The leaders of the nursing home for the elderly, La Caritat in Olot (Gerona), gave a press conference yesterday, in which they highlighted the damage done to the institution by the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmés - the nurse who had killed at least eleven elderly people while working for him.
The director of the nursing home for the elderly, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that & quot; La Caritat would like to sue the person responsible for the deaths, but & quot; the law and our liability force us to accept the lawsuit and the civil liability.
The institution must not only suffer a loss of social standing because it did not detect the criminal activities of the keeper in time, but now it must also pay a large sum of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' family members.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009, and that he continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor examined the deceased personally, but that the formalities were handled by telephone based on their age and illnesses.
The director of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that & quot;'s failure to act could have been the reason for the incidents.
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there is no evidence of negligence by any person other than the accused in the litigation.
The man, already christened the & quot; Angel of Death, confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday, declaring that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009, and one and a half months later he murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat explained that the access of the staff to the medicines is difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin injections and the tranquilizer cocktail in six of the nine crimes the patient committed to free the patient from his suffering by death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will determine whether Vila lied and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by administering them bleach, as he confessed to having done to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the testimony of the keeper, not even in terms of the number of murders confessed, which could easily be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had given very different statements in court, and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his behavior after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to the judiciary for this reason, and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
Threatening gestures by the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that 'the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness'. '
Risk spreads in the euro-peripheral countries have risen dramatically, and European bank stocks have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility of the ECB being mistaken and the euro barely gaining points, which is worrying.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which recovers as it collapses, but only as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank asked us to reverse our liquidity measures, whereby tomorrow, for the fourth time in two years, and probably many more in the future, the ECB will have to reverse course.
The Bundesbank demanded that the plan to purchase government debt be terminated, as it was ineffective, as well as the cancellation of all exceptional temporary liquidity measures. Only a one-week unlimited access period should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect current liquidity measures to be extended at least until March, and for quarterly open-ended tenders to maintain liquidity provision until at least June.
We also expect the bond-buying programme to continue, sending a strengthening signal.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterdays will be set back again, and if stubbornly insisting that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB's meeting in May, when the Bank confirmed that it would not consider buying Sovereign debt securities, and markets collapsed as a result, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government securities in Portugal was rather weak.
The State Asset Management spent only $500 million at 5.28%, down from $750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a shift in perceptions in the markets, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures for the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly 15 000 more. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after failing to recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the numbers provided for in the bailout plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must win parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday. Ireland, still lacking sufficient support, remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated her discourse ahead of the Heads of State and Government Summit on 14 December, where political unity is needed to show that we are playing the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The President of the Government of Spain presented the plan of measures yesterday, which will be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as well as in the financial institutions, reduction of the government's deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi' s Four Seasons to investors' ears.
The Zapatero-Trichet dual effect explains why the Spanish stock market has gained 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of Europe's stock markets.
Compared to February, the reaction of the Government and the Central Bank of Spain was swift and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year government bond, which will benefit from the Trichet effect. This is why we are banking on strong demand, which will remove all doubts about our ability to refinance debt.
For Spain, applying for a relief plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do not need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in keeping with Caesar's wife: & quot; Now it' s not just Being that counts, it's Appearance. & quot;
Only courage, we will manage!
The chairman of the board of Eulen contests at the request of his children the shareholders meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Owls and El Enebro, did not abate.
David Álvarez, founder of the Corporate Gurppe, will contest the Shareholders Meeting of El Enebro, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them absolutely null and void. His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative organs of the company, which owns the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter in the justice system in their dispute for control of a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding in the business services sector appears unwilling to back down in his legal battle for control of the organs of El Enebro.
He was ousted from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting held on 18 January this year, which is already contested in the Commercial Register.
The shareholders meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has set off a new thunderclap in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Appealing to the magistrate to arrange the meeting is the only legal way of ensuring that the meeting of shareholders is convened.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a & quot; desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to get the annulled Assembly of January 18th declared null and void, as officials explain.
This reasoning is the basis of the retrospective challenge of the Assembly to declare it to be & quot; absolutely void & quot;.
The same protagonists, who cover themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judge.
In El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez & apos; seven children control 100% of the capital.
By contrast, the founder of the service group claims 51% of the capital according to Family Protocols.
This is the actual background to the case on which the judge has to decide during the hearing to deal with the contested claim, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved in real-time with software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula One in 2004, their history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the rookie, and despite his steep ascent over the last few seasons, everyone counted on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferraris to win the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to diminish the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the & quot; secret weapon that was put in the hands of the multi Siemens Red Bull, creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software for simulating processes, which the German company released in 2007 for non-car-racing purposes.
This computer science program, called PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants and high-precision instruments.
The aim is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before it is actually built, avoiding errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi' s aircraft, and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Engineering at Siemens, explains that with the use of this software at the Red Bull Formula One factory, & quot; can, in a few hours, almost in real time, design and implement the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm points out that in 1992, the racing stables had an average of 10 engineers who could implement no more than three or four improvements in a single season.
Red Bull's team now has 180 highly skilled young people working. Using powerful computer systems, they perform analysis and make all kinds of changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault claims to be solely responsible.
Modifications are made to materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements.
Changes can be transferred from the simulator's virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production equipment and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit placed on this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in a given season.
Red Bull has built up its high-tech factory to design and manufacture its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres away from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially by journalists - are severely restricted.
All that is happening there is Top Secret.
The workforce consists of 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion, Sebastian Vettel.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the service of its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is zero.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago it was still possible to say that advances in R & amp; E for racing cars contributed 50% to the victory and that the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85% of the success, while the contribution made by pilots is estimated at 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber cannot be replaced by computerized, because they are & quot; unpredictable gladiators & quot;.
HP will open twenty own stores with local distributors in two years' time
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first in a network of 20 shops, each ranging from 80 to 100 square meters, that the multinational plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company is agreeing to this initiative with the already existing 16 multi-brand sales divisions, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn, and El Corte Inglés.
The Vice President of HP España, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the remodeled store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American group plans to open 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of which will be in Spain.
The first ones were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third.
Herrera declined to divulge the upcoming openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The Vice Chairperson, who is also Head of HP Personal Systems, stated that the store opening philosophy is always the same. She relied on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive store decor (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising scheme, stressing that the purpose of & quot;'s network of exclusive outlets is to provide customer service and advice to small and micro-businesses when purchasing, and thereafter, even packaging.
The Barcelona store has a Pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP warranted devices.
An online service connects to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
& quot; This way we can solve problems in ten minutes, sometimes lasting up to two days. & quot;
& quot; This system has been designed especially for small and micro-businesses as well as private customers, as large companies already have their & quot; technical customer service contracts, Helena Herroro explained yesterday.
Sabadell plans to steal & apos; one million customers from its rivals in three years
The executive director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and prophesies the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a collapse in the interest margin, which the banks are trying to compensate for by increasing the fees and the prices of loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years, a subject that remains to be resolved.
Sabadell has found a way to exhaust the next three years, surviving a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive without receiving the public assistance from the FROB, but also to increase its market share by one million private customers - 700,000 if you take away the customers that the bank will lose. This is the big challenge facing this bank, because until now it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its personal customers.
This year, it added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 businesses.
Its retail market share is 3.5%, while business customers account for more than 10%.
Another principle of the Business Plan 2011-2013 is to increase productivity, that is austerity, reduce costs. The Bank will present the challenges it faces together with its annual report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, when the financial crisis has thrown all the plans of banks around the world into chaos.
Sabadell will complete its Optima plan, established four years ago, this year. It was initially planned to run for three years, but due to market conditions it has been extended by one year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main objective of the bank.
At a breakfast hosted by APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a difficult & quot; year & quot; with great reach & quot;
The manager assumes that Spain will only & quot; slowly & quot; emerge from the crisis.
Also, & quot; would be very difficult & quot; to create & quot; work in two or three years - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even though he expects the war over liabilities - which punish interest margins - to abate, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay to maintain liquidity are already being passed on to the price of loans to compensate for shrinking profit margins.
& quot; The topics of liquidity and finance are structural in nature and will put pressure on the loans. & quot;
& quot; We did not turn off the tap, but the interest rate differentials are very high & quot;, admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued an order to its network of branches to restrict long-term loans and increase interest rate differentials (see Cinco Días of 22-27 November).
The manager also admitted that banks were currently looking to increase fees, but within a competitive framework, 'quot;.
Sabadell's plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate deals.
It is not without reason that he asserts that large companies are necessary in Spain.
& quot; Everything will change & quot; in the coming year, he assures.
It stresses that the need for capital is currently rising enormously, and does not exclude the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will go into the red.
He believes the FROB could replace the money market if it raises capital.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive a temporary shutdown of the markets, Sabadell refutes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repo transactions, thus mitigating the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of savings banks mergers
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday dismissed the possibility of a wave of savings banks mergers, stressing the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks started, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase. They reserved the second one.
However, the CEO of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
& quot; I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, it was a matter of adjustments. & quot;
& quot; The largest part is finished. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all major processes are already finished. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has greatly supported all operations. & quot;
At a breakfast hosted by the Aragon Association of Managing Directors and Managers (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the & quot; concentration process was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timeliness of the process, which was previously determined as part of & quot;'s business plans with Banco de España.
& quot; The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, thus we have fulfilled the Basel Convention & quot;.
Olavarrieta explained that & quot; disputes a number of opinions on the slowness of the process, the seriousness of the process, and the foolishness of & quot;, because & quot; Banco de España urges us to complete it on time before the end of the year.
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and 'quot; perhaps & quot; in the whole world, adding that those who doubt this do' dies & quot; without deeper knowledge '.
The manager noted that in the current economic climate, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks that have gone through a very significant & quot; concentration process, which & quot; will be completed as soon as possible.
He also recalled that Spanish banks had very well passed the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and Germany's Red Line
Berlin chose to keep the Euro, while at the same time imposing conditions on the whole of the European Union.
Market tensions have triggered a dual response by the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, starting with tax breaks for small and micro-enterprises, regulating temporary work agencies or ending the 426 euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, up to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as the person responsible for provoking the current crisis.
How can these operations be understood?
Let's face it, Merkel' s position is no fault of hers in public relations.
Quite the opposite, this is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is adopting a radically new perspective on shaping our future, one that clashes with the traditional traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of opposition in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second is the re-introduction of the Deutschmark - although it currently sounds more like science fiction - with the support of a large part of public opinion, around 50% of the population.
The third: redesigning the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishing countries that exceed the benchmarks; possibly stopping payments in some countries as well as extending the cost of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been apparent for some time now. So there are no excuses now.
First, 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created deficit incentives, and the German government pulled a constitutional reform sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany considered necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal came from the Central European country, when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At the time it was heavily criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion was absolutely against a bailout for Greece.
Finally, Merkel came out once again in the last few days of October with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow the rescue of a country while obliging private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European because it drove the Ireland crisis and everything that followed.
But its proposal, albeit somewhat sweetened, was accepted. In the next few months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will make these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line, which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures have to be taken now, the old way of functioning of the euro will cease to exist from this date onwards.
2013 will be the year of the birth of a new currency area, in which infringing countries will be severely punished, may be forced to default, and in this case the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is showing us that we must embark on a tough course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improved productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as advocated by Spain in the boom period, simply will not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It is not just a matter of bringing the public deficit down to 3% of GDP by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do in these conditions is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence calms down.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we are offered until spring 2013.
It appears that Zapatero understood this too, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after last Saturday's meeting with big business, and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite criticising Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like it will change anything.
Among the possibilities being considered, we cannot rule out the possibility of leaving the euro area, which is stuffed with countries that are not serious.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rule avoidance
Tricks like the one performed by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax demonstrate inventiveness, but no desire to evade sanction.
The exclusion allegedly instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match on 23 November against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink to be spilled over whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not, and possibly both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
It is well known that the two players lost time a few minutes before the game ended (their team had clearly won) and committed several fouls before the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would be leading their group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction at the next league match against Auxerre, thus entering the next phase of the game without any cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee fined the club's coach, José Mourinho, two matches and the players involved different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so prevalent that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the debate surrounding the presented case comes from the fact that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which pretends nobility and honor in its anthem and punishes its players on other occasions for similar incidents) played the leading role in it, and from the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocation technician.
In any case, the debate is whether this type of conduct, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contravenes the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute rule circumvention. In fact, this approach conforms to the statutes of sport, but appear to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage done to the spirit of sport should be investigated.
The spirit of sportsmanship defends the physical integrity of the opponent, an aspect that was not compromised by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking undue advantage of the opposition team. Again, this did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we normally understand to be a cheating or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not secretly done to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible, so that it will be punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offenders took from the deliberate fouls.
It is important to emphasize that the rival was not placed in a less favorable position, nor were advantages sought for the game being played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
Nor is it a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players at its disposal.
The advantage, obviously, is that players go into the next phase of the Champions League season without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, unsettled to a certain extent, because the team might leave at some point. Also, this gives sanction to the players who play a card, and moves them to the second card cycle, where they leave with less than the first cycle due to accumulation.
This means that it is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices do not go against the spirit of sport, including strategic decisions to maximize the benefits of the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent any sanction (this would be a clear case of rule circumvention, in fact), instead choosing when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision not to evade or escape punishment.
Although the line between inventiveness and the control environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemics arose out of two factors: because there were two self-exclusions involved, and because of the nature of the provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much of an ethical nature as of an aesthetic nature.
Offer offensive to catch customers for Christmas Group Dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar is letting an avalanche of reservations fall on the days of 16 and 17 December this year.
The celebrations, which the employees themselves pay for, are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the turrón and the Christmas lottery, group dinners are once again available in the run-up to Christmas, providing oxygen to Barcelona's catering and leisure industries. However, due to the economic crisis, they are launching a price offensive to capture the customer segment that is the bulk: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
To complicate the bookkeeping a bit, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) dropped all orders in the week beginning 13th December, resulting in an avalanche of dinner reservations on two peak dates (16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped providing group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order to avoid having to give up this tradition, many employees pay out of their own pocket.
Whatever the economic situation, the demand for lowest prices is high, confirms Gaietà Farràs, President of Barcelona's Restaurants Council.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not yet dare to predict what the holidays will be like this month.
& quot; People think about & apos; umpteen times before they make a reservation. & quot;
& quot; They like to go out, but they keep a close eye on prices & quot;, "he points out.
The store will be well received by those who want to offer 'quality' at good prices with a good service, 'he adds, reminding us that customers save during times of crisis, which is why prices are most sought after by 25 Euro.
A survey of several centrally located restaurants revealed that the evening of 17 December causes the suppliers to collapse.
The Soteras group says that demand is booming for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 Euros. The group has adjusted its menus with complete offers ranging from 25 to 35 Euros to suit the economic situation.
For another leading group, Andilana, which has 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to advance reservations even from the beginning of November.
& quot; We made the impossible possible in order to maintain & quot; previous year's prices with menus for all tastes from $19.95 to $30, - explains Quot;.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 eateries, there is no loss of optimism, as revenues have been flourishing since the second quarter and good, if only for a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are anticipated.
Sources at the Group of Companies point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with pre-Christmas groups of friends.
In addition to the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 Euros or more has been added as a price hit. It appears that customers are willing to spend 10% more than they spent in the previous year, and want more details, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green shoots sprouting, so the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are on the rise again.
From the side of the federation Fecasarm (with associations like the Bar, Restaurant and Leisure Association of Barcelona), the vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that overall reservations are quite & quot; lively & quot;, although the customers knock out the & quot; a maximum & quot;.
The fun of partying, however, did not decrease, regardless of who paid.
Pakistan nuclear program causes major concern in U.S.
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons faster than any other country.
Revelations by Wikileaks confirm Taliban-Pakistan relationship.
The contents of correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirm the enormous concerns of Washington about Pakistan's nuclear program.
The documents on the content of the talks and the way of thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, aside from the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents, reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of nuclear security is not enhanced, but on the contrary, the nuclear arsenal is decreasing, and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country.
In particular, the quirk of the nuclear program of Pakistan - that the weapons are not assembled, but that their individual parts are stored to make destruction more difficult in case of a possible attack - gives Washington sleepless nights.
The risks listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prepared before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: & quot; The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable dispersion of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material & quot;.
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered excessive and a matter of caution, not only by the USA, but also by Russia.
& quot; Pakistan needs to hire severely devout personnel to guard its nuclear facilities; low levels of education and culture give extremist organizations more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs, said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry in a briefing with his North American counterparts.
What is new about the documentary revealed by Julian Assange's web portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation is waning, as is the speed at which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communication with Pakistan as frustrating 'quot;' explained: 'Quite often there is no transparency; we do not receive any response to offers of help or they are refused.'
In another message Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia confirms that & quot; despite the economic catastrophe Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons more rapidly than any other country. & quot;
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the commander-in-chief of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to clarify & quot; that the Pakistani army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups.
Hunting for WikiLeaks boss
Obama appoints a high-level counter-terrorism officer to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red warning to track down and find Assange.
Everything connected with WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts are difficult to elucidate.
Yesterday Interpol issued a & quot; red warning & quot; for locating and tracking & quot; from Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Besides, it is not new, it is from 20th November.
Nor is it related to the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the USA, but to the sexual abuse allegations facing the Australian in Sweden.
The lawyer for the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, also assures & quot; that the police knew where and how to get in touch with Mr. Assange. & quot;
Already on the 20th, the International Police Authority, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not notified until yesterday, after the Swedish authorities had given them the power to do so.
This is the way things are. The 188 Interpol countries are assigned to identify and track down Assange, & quot; in order to arrest him for the moment and extradite him. & quot;
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, according to the organization, many member countries consider the red alert to be a carte blanche for detention - which must be conducted by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case in Sweden and the United Kingdom, where Assange is likely to be located.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via video conference.
You also recall that Assange applied to leave Sweden and was granted the permit by the prosecutor, who is likened to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's head of security.
& quot; This is like a hunt, not a prosecution & quot;, is accused in the letter.
While the world searches for him - and his mother declares her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine, via Skype, from an unspecified location. During the interview, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
& quot; If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN, violating international treaties signed by the USA, she should resign & quot;, he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation 'ridiculous and absurd'.
& quot; I am not sure why we should value a guy's opinion with a website & quot;,' he told the broadcaster CNN.
Obama himself has entrusted a high-level official in charge of the fight against terrorism, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to devote less attention to Assange runs counter to the opinions expressed these days by conservative politicians and commentators.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House National Security Committee from January onwards, has asked the State Department to investigate the possibility of adding WikiLeaks to the list of terrorist organizations, & quot; to seize their funds and to track down anyone who supports them or contributes to them. & quot;
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone further, saying Assange'must be assassinated'.
& quot; Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something. & quot;
The person who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
& quot; Whoever leaked information to the government is guilty of treason, and anything that is not an execution is too-lenient a punishment & quot;, 'he told channel Fox.
Puigcercós looks for peace in the ERC with a wink on his face
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret ballot on his continued in-office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the principle of assembly.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for avoiding for the umpteenth time an internal uproar in the ranks of the directionless ERC, after losing 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The leader of the party is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for those close to former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he is also aware that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as its mentor himself, and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that ERC's over 200 regional councillors will be able to vote to keep him in post.
With ballots, not with raising hands.
If the carodists wanted to impose a penalty ticket on the president, they could do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the impression of division as well as submission to himself.
In several interviews he reaffirmed that he did not feel validated by half of the votes plus one, and he added without giving any percentage values, that a & quot; Bulgarian-style result 'quot; would not be good either.
Those close to Carod are demanding more from the President than simply giving his office to the party. This is not enough, because Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the Congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the Leadership will submit to the Council for its vote on 18.
Their intention is to guarantee Puigcercós in exchange for promising to bring the Congress forward to the fall of 2011, which the party's leadership already regards as a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the & quot; polyphony & quot; damages stability and strives once and for all to enable the organization to do its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the current co-seller Josep Huguet subscribed to in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the leader of the party was supported by & quot; in exchange for various goals.
He listed five, of which two are in the foreground.
Firstly, the & quot; restructuring of the board to make it represent at least 90% of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the principle of the full assembly as functioning.
In doing so, he is advocating a reform of the constitution to allow congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercó's & apos; team, which has fought for it in the last two congresses, is obsessed with ending the Assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, during the 2008 earthquake, the leadership of the party was tasked with reviewing the principle of the assembly at a congress to examine the reform of the statutes.
This date has not yet been set because infogle, the internal turmoil of the last years, did not recommend addressing this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors in the lurk, the time may have come to pick up this matter and close it down for good.
23 killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO count, México has recorded four fewer cases than in 2010.
In November 23 people were murdered in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO México count.
Among the killed are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we come to a total of 390 deaths, most likely linked to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearm-induced shots, the mercy shot was fired at his head and his feet and hands were shackled with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Street in the community of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the municipality of Naucalpan.
Early on Thursday, the 4th, farm workers found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal bullets wounds to the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway, on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
A message believed to have been signed by the Crimean organization La Familia Michoacana was found next to the body.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times after leaving his home to work as a garbage truck driver.
On November 7th, two 30-year-olds died of a gunshot wound to the head in the village of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, in the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with a gun shot in his forehead was found along a lonely path in the settlement of El Naranjo, with a cartridge shell fired from a.caliber firearm underneath.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the settlement Playa Golondrina.
Emergency services searched for the body parts but could not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán were notified of the discovery of a body found in the area of Peña Colorada. Their hands were tied behind their backs and their heads were bandaged.
The man had a wound resulting from a firearm shot in the neck.
Earlier this month, it was reported that two men were murdered, wrapped in blankets, and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda, in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two death threats were also found.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes, in the locality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women covered in blankets were discovered in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning, in Huixquilucan, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket was found, according to the message left by his murderers next to him, and his name was probably Mario Ríos.
In the settlement San Francisco Acuautla of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with firearm bullets in the neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte as well as necklaces with corresponding pictures were discovered on the woman's skin.
In the last month, in the municipality of Zinacantepec, the body of a man with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group was found next to a vehicle.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with duct tape and a communication were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the bodies was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, which read: 'This is happening to those who do not participate'.
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found with hands and feet tied, with signs of torture, inside a taxi parked behind the San Agustín Judicial Centre.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes la Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was beheaded in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón, wrapped in black plastic bags, with a message next to it. The second was tortured and was found in a plastic bag on the streets of the settlement of Juárez.
Next to him, police found a cardboard box with a message.
China maintains greenhouse gas reduction targets
The Chinese representative told COP16 that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and that it will maintain its offer to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China keeps its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, this country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei asserted that his country has made a tremendous effort to reduce carbon footprints and convert its industry.
He noted that over the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China's climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing the emission of gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states collaborated with those of the central state and municipalities to achieve the goals of energy saving, effective use of energy and reduction of emissions.
Furthermore, he pointed out that several multi-year plans have already been started or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those receiving funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Effective Utilization Program, which has been in place for the last five years and has received investment from the United Nations (UN), government and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, government scientific adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly believed to be the case.
He pointed out that per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China are six tons per person, compared to 100 tons in the United States. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented strides in the area of energy use. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent in the last five years, with more to come by 2020, he explained.
Legal Exclusion: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Party leader has the right to go to the National Commission of Order and demand what is allowed to him by law.
The national leader of the PAN, Cesar Nava Vázquez, asserted that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was lawful, and that the former leader of the PAN has the right to appeal to the National Commission for Order and to demand what the law grants him.
In an interview that took place prior to Gabino 'Cué Monteagudo' s complaint as the state's governor, he explained that Espino' s disqualification was a decision made at the local level.
& quot; This is an independent decision of the Sonoran Supervision Commission. & quot;
& quot; Mr Espino has the right to appeal to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional to ensure that a decision is taken by a competent authority, & quot;, he added.
On the other hand, he said, it is not time to think about 2012, and that an alliance of presidential candidates has never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote scheduled for December 4-5, when his successor will be chosen.
& quot; This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not yet. It was a proposal for municipal election, was successful and served its purpose. & quot;, he explained.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so & quot; does not frighten internal competition; on the contrary, & quot; we enjoy it and it strengthens us & quot;, he commented.
He said that the council would no doubt select the best Chair that Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it will pass the relay & quot; to the one that the council will designate. & quot;
& quot; I am quite unconcerned and open about this. I would be proud to assign the office of party chairman to each of the five. & quot;
He predicted that the party's upturn recorded in the last election held on July 4th will be reflected in the next election, although & quot; does not have time to think about 2012. & quot;
& quot; Now it's a matter of assisting Governor Gabino Cué in his task. & quot;
In this regard, he pointed out that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be flying the flag and will be observed throughout the country. Therefore, & quot; many hopes and longings are placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino is on the level of the requirements. & quot;
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his disc rate during his four-year rule, Cesar Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year tenure of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
& quot; If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, they should finally come out of the closet & quot;, he reiterated.
He believes that the owner of the federal government can use phrases like the one he uses in his discourse at the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no mouth ban in this country, much less censorship.
Obama campaigns for undocumented student law on Twitter
& quot; If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act Act, call your senators and push for passage of this bill & quot;, the President of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today backed a nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act, a law legalizing undocumented students, with a message posted on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
& quot; If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act Act, call your senators and push for passage of this bill & quot;, 'Obama tweeted.
His memo includes a cyberlink to a more extensive document, inviting the public to interact with their senators in advance of the bill's vote.
& quot; With your voice that we are waiting for, now is the time to listen to you & quot;, "he emphasizes.
The news came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any bill except expanding Bush-era tax breaks and government funding.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the voting of the Dream Act bill and other projects, such as the ratification of the new anti-nuclear proliferation START treaty with Russia.
Asked about the Republicans' blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest.
& quot; I think we have a lot of time left... & quot;
& quot; We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year... & quot;
& quot; I think we can reach an agreement on it at any time, and then we can plan the rest 'expiry date & quot;,' he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he 'quot; would request the vote at the close of the debate to bring forward the Dream Act - legislation to legalize undocumented students in the Senate beginning next Thursday, though the next week is more likely.
The version of the Dream Act Act, or the American Dream, would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in the country for the last five years, and are enrolled in higher education, or in the military.
But supporters of the bill need sixty votes to pass the bill, so they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, advocacy organizations are organizing a full-scale effort to influence the adoption of the bill.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against the bill, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the bill.
That's why the defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most-courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they have said they will no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who came out in favor of the bill, John McCain, has not yet determined his position.
Although the House has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of & apos; The desire for the language of & apos; was a walk where the participants fought for the narrative
& quot; I understand the subject of sex in speech, but... The Finger in the Wound? What is expected of me? & quot; asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of & apos; Los placeres de la lengua & apos;, a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature, using the subtitle of her question on this occasion (at another event, she explained, the Roundtable was devoted to Sex in Language).
The Finger in the Wound... & quot; gets us into trouble & quot;, spat the Argentine writer sweetly at the audience, which was mainly made up of young people gathered at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to attend this roundtable moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcia Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz later characterized as a great narrative. Luisa narrates in first person and is the protagonist who is in search of experiencing what & quot; Wound & quot; goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer but hints at the guideline of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: & quot; Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound. & quot;
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: & quot; the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar. & quot;
The main character of the story sighs with relief and concludes that she only learned from the wound that it was really open and did not exist. But she is convinced that the pleasure of language and its traps become mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, toyed with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called & apos; praise for invention & apos;, in which the finger in the wound is omitted but discovered.
Alluding to magical realism, he tells the story of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back distant men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative does a U-turn, telling the story of America, the great novel that from the beginning had no shortage of its own chronicler, and he quotes Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquistadors.
& quot; Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), ridiculed the fake witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even the feeling of shame was lost. & quot;
However, he stresses that & quot; is the place where the crazy and the liar best imagine things, and where reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fiction reaches its zenith.
He actually calls this the & apos; tradition Cervantes & apos;.
& quot; We inherited from him to be what is narrated. & quot;
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that FIl' s Round Table & apos; The Finger in the Wound & apos; contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted her contribution to the great wound of societal violence that afflicts her country - as it does all of Latin America - as a result of the drug-trafficking struggles.
& quot; I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, non-premeditated commitment to & quot;, she explained, after stressing that literature is communication and commitment built up between the author and the reader like a & quot; chemical reaction & quot;.
The evening ended with the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted the finger of the committed writer in the wound of the & quot; writer.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, even the intellectual habits and control of consciousness end up dogmatisms, forgetting that behind every confirmation there is a small no, and behind every denial there is a small yes. & quot;
& quot; In order to be in possession of our thought and of reality, we must nuance: And nuance often means putting a finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking without nuance in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in pre-conceived ideas, and also harassing the powerful who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he noted, inviting them to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three losses in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive matches.
The duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final match also pitted two different styles set by their respective coaches, and their opposites were reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has a history of three losses in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive matches, and so far he has held his own, so this opportunity is very important for him.
The Argentinian has risen to become the second champion with the medal, he has fallen one step behind the champions and, amazingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The Santist strategist reached the first final as coach at & apos; Torneo Apertura 2002 & apos;, when del Morelia had the reins in hand, with which he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at & apos; Clausura 2003 & apos;, he reached the decisive duel, which he lost also with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna at the & apos; Torneo Bicentenario 2010 & apos;, where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, because the match ended in a draw with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes, but on the penalty kick Rubén advanced with 3-1 and had two chances to claim his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with his great rival Monterrey. Therefore, he does not want to be haunted by misfortune again and to break free of the evil spell in order to celebrate a title for the first time, although he reiterates that the most important thing to him is the game itself.
& quot; I want to become a champion, I don 't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for the affection I give myself to, and that' s why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing, & quot;, the helmsman commented when asked about the endings lost.
The last game is still fresh in his memory, he claims to have learned a lot from it: & quot; The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee blows his whistle we cannot celebrate, we at the line are prepared, the players too, because last time we were already prepared to retire with two penalties, and I think that is a lesson, until the game is over there is no reason to celebrate. & quot;
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shoot-outs does not worry him, because he trusts his players: & quot; Never want to finish on penalty shoot-outs, finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared, on the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate prepared us for a bad match, sometimes as a result of nervousness or a fierce desire to hold the title in our hands, that left us something for this final, and we hope that will not happen this time.
Romanso has the power to stop being second champion and taste the glory of the titles for the first time.
USA changes the rules for obtaining a visa
People need to present themselves to the visa services before they can go to the consulate for a visa application, reducing costs.
Starting from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the embassy of the United States and in the consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, most applicants will have to introduce themselves to the Visa Application Services (ASC), the initials in English, before being interviewed at the consulate.
ASC staff records the biometric data of the applicant, which is verified by the consulate before the call is made.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, which include:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases because there is no longer any need to pay separately for the appointment, processing the visa application and transportation service used to deliver the document.
The applicant only makes one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for request visas (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for traders and investors.
Those who only wish to renew their visa do not need to go to the consulate, they only need to go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
As the biometric data is fetched from the ASC, applicants requiring a second appointment to the consulate will be left there less than before.
Those applying for a visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey, and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service charge.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure can be found at: http: / / mexico. usembassy. gov / boletines / sp101201 _ Visas-FAQs. html
NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference to announce a find tomorrow that will have implications for the search for life in space.
Tomorrow (Thursday), the United States National Aerospace Administration (NASA) announced an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of alien life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1pm at a press conference held at NASA Headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. This is a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present to & quot; a supervisory find for the search for alien life, prompting speculation by experts in other countries.
The discovery could substantiate the theory that human-like creatures can exist in hostile environments that have been previously considered uninhabitable. The hypothesis was raised that these creatures could transform into intelligent creatures - like humans - if their living conditions improve.
Apparently, this is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment considered to be too poisonous for all conceivable life forms, as the lake is high in arsenic.
In some way, the microbiome uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this into account, it increases the chances that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that there is actually another life form, a second life form, which differs from the one we know. & quot;
The Space Agency will announce the actual range of its find at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), asking if its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
Reforming the organ law of Congress introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and an opposition bloc was already in place, headed by the PRD, PT, Convergencia, and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who introduced himself as an independent. The four questioned the entry of the & apos; two-party system & apos; into the chamber.
Before the start of the inaugural session of the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD, and Patrón Montalvo railed against the reform of the organ law, saying that doing so would exclude them.
This reform, they repeated, would introduce a & apos; two-party system, because now there would be two people, the same number as parties controlling the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau headed by the panellist Salvador Lopez Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity of Vice President.
Corvera Quevedo explained that with these reforms the PRI and PAN parties have institutionally established their marginalized political position.
He said that in the next few days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and the PRI to change the scheme, assuming that they have the political will to do so, and if they do not have it, they will be subjugated by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
& quot; Until this point, I (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they do not even consider the opinion of the others. & quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia said there were similarities with the PRD, PT, and Patrón, and that a pluralistic group was therefore formed.
It cannot be allowed, he went on, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be & quot; duopolistic & quot;.
& quot; It is not the spirit of law reform that Congress should have an eternal two-party system. & quot;
& quot; To begin with, this group of five Members will talk to additional colleagues to become more & quot;, explained the Convergencia Member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to the PAN and PRI, pointed out that the Congress is currently turning into a & apos; booty & apos; for two.
& quot; Previously it was just one party, now they split it up into two. & quot;
Patrón Montalvo requested respect for the Members and their place at the negotiating tables.
& quot; It is not because of high-level decisions that five, who will probably be nine MEPs, are to be left out. The five, currently seen as divided into different groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because because of the reform that has been done and agreed upon by the others, we have stayed out and we do not agree with this reform. & quot;
200 000 Peso more for 'quot; the supplier' quot;
The municipality of Mazatlán is paying another cheque to the controversial owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque for a little over 200 000 Peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the municipality.
This brings the total amount paid in the second half of the year to 1 200 000 Pesos.
According to the Municipal Transparency website, on November 16 last year, this cheque with the number 9258447, for an amount of 200,144.56 Peso, was issued with the purpose of & quot; clearing outstanding invoices.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno has already predicted that more money from the municipality would go to this supplier. It is being watched by the Superior del Estado Auditorium because it sells at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed and, consequently, the number of cheques still being written out in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
& quot; Nothing has been bought from & quot;;, just the debts will be paid, just like with the other suppliers & quot;, 'he said in an interview.
The last cheques & quot; reappeared during the last quarter of the year. & quot;: September 24, two from October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last one from November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the Treasurer assured that its services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on 25 July the audit of cheques issued by the municipality to its suppliers, it became known that previously, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality paid over 10 million Pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also transactions in Jumapam, where she withdrew cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist spots need to be improved in penetrating
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After a foreign tourist fell into the sinkhole at Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourist industry requested that the authorities give special attention to areas that are in bad shape and have a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Zona Dorada Dealers Association, recalled that there have been a number of calls to maintain the destination and turn the bad conditions experienced by tourists into new job opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of roads and pavements had had a negative impact, with tourists stopping to stroll and see the clutter, and then turning their backs to nearby shops.
& quot; Politicians do not know what it means to have to close a business one day, and they do not worry about how much money one loses, because otherwise they would not be able to carry out the construction work slowly and haphazard in this way. & quot;
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall highlighted the city' s lack of prevention and maintenance.
& quot; The community must assume its responsibilities and avoid a repeat of this. How does it do this? Well, preventative maintenance instead of retrofitting & quot;, he explained.
& quot; We are eager to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city needs to change its strategy to keep the city in a good state. & quot;
& quot; There are other passages that also look unkempt and unfinished & quot;, he said, & quot; for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán. & quot;
& quot; Nowadays, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. We need to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in good shape, & quot;, he added.
& quot; Not enough attention has been paid to these precautions, and these kinds of incidents only highlight what is obvious to all: urgent need for maintenance. & quot;
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist resorts of Mazatlán because they were not properly used and gave a bad impression.
He mentioned a number of places that need to be revamped along with the city. Making the city clean, orderly and attractive to tourists should be the priority.
& quot; Fortunately, Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites that would need to be cleaned up and cleaned up in order to make them attractive to tourists and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP requesting results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, suggested that the parliamentarians should take the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business community is demanding a dignified parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is troubled and facing major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th parliament was inaugurated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN deputies, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one more from PVEM. This makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
New members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, be committed to society and the diverse social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the Entrepreneurship Coordination Council (CCE), suggested that the new legislators take on the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
& quot; We hope that Members of Parliament really do exercise their right to trade freely of collusion between the parties, since it is customary for Members to enter into agreements with which they defend their own interests, turning themselves into carnival compliments of the ruling parties and the leaders of the parliamentary groups. & quot;
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
& quot; We make sure that they do a trustworthy job and, above all, that they stand up for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them at the last elections. & quot;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, President of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the great challenges facing the 40 elected representatives of the city is driving and working together for the state's economic growth, because nowadays, the economic situation is extremely complicated.
& quot; The most important thing is that they will drive economic growth, stimulate investment, and create infrastructure measures that will in any way promote job creation. & quot;
With regard to the tourism industry, he asked the new MEPs to give the Ministry of Tourism the necessary place in the government's budget for promotion purposes.
& quot; I understand that it is the ministry with the second fewest resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign currency and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry. & quot;
Money must be allocated to tourist projects, state security must be provided, and the alcohol law, which has not been revised in previous terms, must be updated.
Seeking Holy King
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are the longings of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
On the next day of Epiphany, it will be difficult for the parents to fulfil these wishes, because the household consists of no more than twelve persons and one male goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so crave.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live hand-to-mouth because their father has no steady job.
& quot; Sometimes hard times come because my husband has no job. But we do sell tangerines and potatoes... In the afternoon, I go out into the street with the brats to sell. & quot; said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida likes a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a & apos; monster car for some time now, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes one-year-old clothes.
& quot; (José Alfredo) told me that & apos; I really liked this monster & apos;, but I replied, & apos; let's wait and see, boy & apos;, because it was very expensive & quot;, Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older children who were at school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old Maria Guadalupe is a size 12, while ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
The 14 year old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair of size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can join the & apos; Saint King is Wanted & apos; campaign by donating a toy or cash in the Noroeste Newspaper's lobby.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday around ten house searches were carried out in the context of breaking up a network of cannabis production and distribution in the administrative region of Estria.
Fourteen people were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, the places where the alleged drug-making took place.
& quot; Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment used for production have been confiscated, reported Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security Police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women have been arrested, two of the men believed to be the main ringleaders of the drug ring are from Sherbrooke.
The people arrested are said to have appeared outside the Sherbrooke Courthouse just hours after they were arrested.
They could be charged, among other things, with the production of cannabis, the possession of cannabis for sale, conspiracy and the service of crime.
These house searches were the result of a lengthy investigation lasting over a year.
& quot; The information we have received from the authorities has enabled us to carry out these arrests, explained M. Ruel.
Around 70 officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
Clandestine immigration could be tracked easily
The Conservative bill, which the government says will regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret migrants, is expected to be kicked out after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday they could not support the proposal.
& quot; I strongly oppose this charter. & quot;
& quot; I'm with a party that has chained you to its feet, 'Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff told the assembled lawmakers at the end of the weekly caucus session.
Liberals claimed the bill, which allows any person coming from a seagoing vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants, to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, leader of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the draft law because it targets the wrong group.
& quot; We are against, and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we 'll see what the government does, & quot; explained M. Duceppe.
Criticism over immigration from Olivia Chow, of the NDP, has brushed off critics who claim that her party is not steadfast enough in the face of clandestine immigrants.
& quot; The neo-democrats agree to take action against the stowaways, and that's' what we are trying to do by brokering another bill, C-35, 'Chow said.
We do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame refugees and keep children imprisoned & quot; for at least one year, 'Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
& quot; The Canadians are emphatically telling the Members of Parliament that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine immigration, these criminal acts that affect Canada and that treat the country like a doorstep. & quot;
& quot; They expect Canada to take tough action & quot;, according to Minister Kennedy's response.
& quot; The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law, which could have led the country into elections that the government rejected.
However, a Conservative source told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unit cannot find unanimity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the possible creation of a new standing unit to combat corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for a public inquiry into the issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, maintains that this idea does not originate from yesteryear: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this matter last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Still, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than just one person.
It has to be said that, despite Robert Dutil's presence, this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
There was also no shortage of evidence that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement as a 'quot; rabbit out of a hat' announcement, as well as' quot; solution crafted at the end of the table '.
Minister Dutil, in turn, addressed those who fear that political power has too much influence over the future unity in question.
& quot; You will see the result when we announce it & quot;, "he was content to affirm.
& quot; Man is aware of this problem. & quot;
According to Réjean Parent, President of CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public poll.
& quot; The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this investigative committee, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide, & quot; will follow, 'he explained.
& quot; The only means to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest & quot;, explained Yves Boisvert, Lecturer in Ethics and Policy Systems at the ENA (State University for the Training of Senior Administrators).
In order to break this deadlock, he proposes that the Quebec should have a special mandate for auditing to investigate corruption and collusion.
& quot; One should be able to expand the mandate of audit control, so it decided.
He also argues that Quebec could grant audit powers the same as commissioners, which would allow it to force people to testify.
Formating a standing unit isn 't the only project in the Charest government drawer.
The Quebec will also ask Ottawa to amend the penal code to make it more attuned to this type of crime.
This request was made by the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of prosecution is ambiguous.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering certain amendments relating to this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which dealt with motorcycle police groups, 131 people were arrested, although the penal code was not amended.
Ottawa has enforced the Gangsterism Act as a result.
Rivers under Strict Monitoring
Several rivers remain under heavy guard due to heavy rainfall that has been pouring down since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, in Mauricie county, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two homes were evacuated preemptively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road collapsed in the process.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain from 40 to 70 milliliters of rain fell on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 more millimetres of rain was expected here depending on the regions until Thursday evening.
The worst affected areas were north of the river and the Outaouais valley.
There had been up to 100 millimetres of rain.
Since snowmelt has already accumulated in certain sub-regions, it is feared that several streams will flow over these precipitations.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued flood alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentiine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become here the object of flood control and remain under observation.
In Lanaudière, heavy rainfall caused lakes to flow over in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a backup bridge was torn away due to heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, in particular in the commune of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Security Service remains on high alert and is monitoring the situation closely, Security Counsellor Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec National High Water Centre issued flood warnings on Wednesday for large increases in several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partial rebuke Dupont
The Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before Canada's Board of Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) for his controversial remarks on social welfare and Haitians as well as his abusive language on radio.
The CCNR maintains that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinions, certain statements made by & quot; include inaccurate information about social welfare and unwarranted negative portrayals of Haitians, as well as such crude language that is inappropriate for daytime programming. & quot;
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who have committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the broadcasts aired during the period of 2008 and 2010.
The first order was lodged following a complaint lodged by the & quot; Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec & quot;.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts quoted in the shipment were inaccurate.
Moderators should provide sound information, rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont expressed the opinion that suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message being conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
& quot; The majority of the Supervisory Board considers that the consequences of the broadcast of & quot; Dupont le midi & quot; would have touched upon a sensitive subject in a family-friendly and appropriate manner.
As a result, he was not reprimanded.
The last point of contention was the statements that had been made regarding the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort fought a dispute in the media, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator explained that he did not donate to help Haiti, because he did not know for sure if the needy would actually receive the donations.
The Supervisory Board considers that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect is an unwarrantedly negative portrayal of Haitians.
& quot; I have already served my three-day suspension sentence in this matter. & quot;
& quot; My file has been virgin & quot; for a year and a half, explained the moderator.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of crude language.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM announcer & quot; acted beyond his obligations & quot;.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was, inter alia, obliged to notify its decisions once during prime time within a period of three days, are negligible.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Algerian origin, has embarked on a very particular course.
The athlete, who excels in & quot; Sanda & quot; (Full-time contact Kung-Fu), kickboxing as well as Thai boxing, is now stepping onto the tatami and the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
& quot; I started martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria. & quot; said Zemmal, who has been living in the city since 2008 to continue his development among the pros.
Personally, I am looking for the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground fight as presented by the mixed martial arts, contests in North America are rare. & quot;
Recently, the security officer employed by UPS gave bad news to his rivals by winning two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship, held in Edinburgh, Scotland, between 23 and 30 October.
& quot; I won the Full Contact Kickboxing and Thai Boxing categories & quot;, 'he explained.
& quot; Currently preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China. & quot;
& quot; Invited were the fighters from each category who finished in the top four at the last World Championship. & quot;
& quot; I won bronze in Toronto in 2009. & quot;
& quot; In 2005, I finished 8th in Vietnam. & quot;
& quot; In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in 5th place, while in 2009, I finished 3rd in Toronto, & quot; added.
& quot; It is noteworthy that I have progressed in each match. & quot;
& quot; With this rhythm, I will be first this time or next year!
& quot; San Shou & quot; or & quot; Sanda & quot; are disciplines originating in China in which punches and kicks are permitted, as well as ground strokes.
Duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most famous boxer to emerge from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal have only one event left in his career, he would most certainly call it his presence at the Super Tournament & quot; King of Sanda & quot;, the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
& quot; This match is the highest ranking and most respected & quot; in China, explained the friendly Pfundskerl.
& quot; It is a bit like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand's largest). & quot;
& quot; This was a great experience. & quot;
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
& quot; The one who defeated me was a real pro & quot;, so he analyzed.
& quot; There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg). & quot;
& quot; The semifinal winners meet in the final of their category.
& quot; Then the winners of each category face off to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu. & quot;
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Quebec has, by common consent, granted project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without bidding.
This consortium, called & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;, was formed in 2004 as a corollary of Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust its responsibility to the private sector to handle this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the & quot; Énergie gérance & quot; consortium secured the lucrative contract without any public tender.
For Parti Québécois, resorting to business consortia poses a serious ethical problem, leading to the risk of displacement of competition and price increases.
& quot; This is a new way of playing a concerted game and weakens the competition. & quot;
& quot; This means that instead of collusion, instead of collusion, games will now be played in an open format, 'PQ deputy Sylvain Simard said at the press conference yesterday.
Early in the day, Simard raised the issue before the National Assembly, because he finds it difficult to understand how the public's interest can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau responded on the afternoon by vehemently denying that the deal was a stitch-up.
& quot; I remain true to my line & quot;, she railed, asserting that the PQ had acted & quot; dishonestly & quot;, and that it lacked & quot; toughness & quot;.
She said it's the least & quot; could do for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium model is standard practice worldwide.
This is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in relation to a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The & quot; Eastmain & quot; project has a high level of complexity in terms of its amount of work.
Construction is underway and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any possibility of competition; negotiations had already taken place.
Moreover, even for relatively simple projects, the Quebec-based consortium's model is no longer an exception.
As & quot; Le Devoir & quot; noted last week, the consortium's model applied to civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief flip through the Quebec Enterprise Register allows you to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of duration.
In this way, Dessau, for example, will work in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, is attributed to the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
As far as the & quot; consortium is concerned, Minister Normandeau stressed that & quot;'s territory is subject to a special labor dynamics, and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special attention to this fact' s in particular since the 1970s.
Réal Laporte, the major employer of Société d 'apos; énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), issued a statement that raised eyebrows with the fact that the Project Management Contract was approved by consensus.
& quot; If you apply for a job, and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will soar. & quot;
& quot; So you have two choices: either you take the people who are in that market and tell yourself they will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price. & quot;
& quot; The idea, however, is that it is not the price that counts, but the expertise of the people behind & quot;, stressed Laporte.
This contract granted to the & quot; Énergie gérance & quot; consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Upon review, & quot; Le Devoir & quot; counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts awarded to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular Resource Laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had won 22 contracts, Génivar received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without counting their holdings in & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;.
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the $295 131 564 contract with & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of & quot; Parti libéral du Québec were well known & quot;.
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally aligned with the companies that financed it 'quot; before specifying that it was actually their executives.
Barometer of Responsible Consumption - The & quot; green & quot; label is not trust inspiring
Green, but frankly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but equally little in the labeled brands or the eco-labels that will guide his or her choices.
It is a pity, given that it bathes in a universe dominated by the media, where it is awash with information in favour of more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption is bemoaning a lack of credible information, an inadequacy which is a brake on its commitment, as was shown in the first reading held yesterday.
Although they sped up the consumption of so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebec citizens seem to give little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec citizens admit they do not trust companies' environmental commitment any more than they do their green corporate advertising, according to the new measurement developed by the University of Sherbrooke's consumer center.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on the subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
Informing consumers about responsible consumption seems to be important in stimulating this consumption segment, which currently is enlivened by nearly only a third of Quebec's consumers.
Indeed, emptiness and the dubious nature of the information dampened the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer, after the higher price of the products.
Moreover, a third of Quebec people are suspicious of the reported performance of the green products and services that they are trying to provide.
According to another communication, more than half of the consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, mostly changing the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, 61% of them also favored purchases from merchants in their neighborhood, favoring purchases of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - this year, the index of environmentally conscious consumption reached a 64 of maximum value of 100 - Quebec's Homo consumus loves to present himself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce the traces left in the environment by taking care of the welfare of animals.
However, the social and ecological awareness seems to stop at one's car, according to the barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebec citizens reported using public transport or favoring the ride-sharing service in order to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking and cycling were also favored by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavior survey that feeds into stereotypes.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, invited by Société Angus and Parallèle to contribute financially to the acquisition of eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The Angus development company and the Parallèle company, which had hoped to receive a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to acquire eXcentris, the cinema complex belonging to Daniel Langlois, on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to restore it to its true cinematic function, apparently did not receive what they requested.
The government has agreed to get involved, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a loan of less than the initially hoped-for amount, which could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least according to the sources extracted from the state rumor mill.
A first action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the request has since been revised downwards.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the & quot; Société de développement des entreprises culturelles & quot; (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her a final factual report.
However, the Cabinet's counter-proposal was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to reply.
In any case, the premise of state donations really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of cinema owners rebelled against a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial support for real estate projects there, which he had not given to other cinemas.
However, several other market participants in the Segment objected to substantial economic assistance.
Cinema director Daniel Langlois, after having built the cinema himself, had, with great difficulty, presented the auteur cinema on the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years, which could justify an exceptional position on the part of the state.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is abundantly evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele entertained.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle headed by Christian Yaccarini are heading for a privately financed campaign, which they hope will raise $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallelèle.
The aim of the prospective acquirer is to reopen the three cinemas on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois & quot; Des hommes et des dieux & quot;.
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not removed the newspaper & quot; Le Devoir & quot;, and one ignores what he and his group think of the proposals that have been made to them, revised downwards.
Secret of complex shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic cables, disseminated through WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers inferiority to the Americans in the inferiority complex of Canadians; but, at the same stroke, they reveal the superiority of the latter vis-à-vis Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are astonished that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind when he goes to the polls, and they believe that President Obama's visit helped the conservative government to get its 2009 budget through!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, made public yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantive content to nibble at.
A link dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period when the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations ceases to participate in the operations discussed by its political leaders.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador stationed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers several explanations for this situation.
& quot; A complex of inferiority that is almost inherent in Canadians may well prompt Canadian political leaders to discuss the internal controversies of everyday life, rather than pass the buck to the United States in this election (as in the free-trade campaign of 1988), & quot;, as he describes it.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of & quot;.
The Ambassador understands this deafening silence, especially since the two countries have intense political and economic ties.
& quot; Logically, this is how & quot; evaluates, & quot; should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more of a party leader to conduct such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind when going to the ballot box as a key factor. & quot;
The other expression of this feeling of importance appears in the memo sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, intended to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
& quot; Your trip will help to ensure the continuation of the government during the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, resulting from a $30-40 billion stimulus program. & quot;, Breese describes.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament being overthrown by the coalition, and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008, written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast on CBC is spreading from the United States.
The Ambassador is alarmed at programs like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, which contain few subtle references to Maher Arar, the & quot; No-Fly-List & quot;, or even diversions for purposes of interrogation conducted by CIA spooks.
Another memo details how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner, during their first bilateral meeting, if Europe was willing to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes, but only on the basis of an individual & quot; case to case & quot; decision.
At the end of the meeting, as described by & quot;, he presented the Secretary of State with a paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15 year old Muslim of Canadian origin. & quot;
& quot; The secretary of state has agreed to review the file.
Lastly, let us note that tempers are running high over the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old adviser who is very close to Stephen Harper, had declared on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be 'killed'.
He had been referring to Mike Huckabee of the United States.
Worldwide lighting renewal plan
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of homes, commerce and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (CFCs) equal to almost one third of the additional reduction that will have to be achieved in order to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the major concrete projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted from lighting on Earth would be avoided if the incandescent white bulbs, which are still a 50-70% monopoly on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better yet, light-emitting diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
This equals the equivalent of 70% of the exhaust emissions from the world's fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, major exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans aimed at reducing global CFC emissions from 53Gt to 49Gt.
However, we would still have to subtract 5 Gt from this balance in order to stabilise the climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius from now to 2020, in order to prevent it from spiralling out of control.
In the white-incandescent bulbs 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%. With the new LED light bulbs, this energy consumption is reduced by twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10.000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched this week by the manufacturer Philips - this company, incidentally, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours, and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an indication of the potential savings of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that these completely new light bulbs only emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury, which means that they have to be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries unless the producers provide a receiving point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not compact fluorescent bulbs, but coal-fired power stations, which emit much more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would generate as a result of this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion annually buying electricity and eight million tons of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations, which would cost Indonesia $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast anxiously awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the 'quot; immediate' publication of the results of Ivory Coast's presidential election immediately after its deadline.
& quot; The Secretary-General underlines the need of the Independent Election Commission to maintain its work and to publish the provisional results without further delay,'said a spokesman for the UN chief.
& quot; asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the preliminary results are announced. & quot;
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the electoral commission had allowed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight to pass, three days after Sunday's election, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI confirmed on television that the & quot; Commission would continue working to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were many calls from around the world for the CEI to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of elections, headed by outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the Constitutional Council to annul & quot; fraudulent votes in the north, obtained by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the failed coup of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N & apos; Guessan, Ivory Coast's presidential campaign director, confirmed that the FN's tactics of intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred the president' s supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be cancelled if the grievances brought by Gbagbo are considered by the Constitutional Council.
However, Gbagbo opponents are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N' apos; Dré, a man with close political ties to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, described the delay in announcing the election results as' quot; unacceptable 'and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he did not go as far as to claim victory.
His allies maintain that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew he lost; and that to lodge a complaint with the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results was illegal.
The second round of Sunday's presidential election was billed as the culmination of the unification and reconciliation process of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned Ivory Coast's leaders on Wednesday that they could be held responsible if violence breaks out.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of voting on October 31st, with 38% of the vote, compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as the leading candidate.
Unemployment Rate Stable in Third Quarter
According to the International Labour Office (IAA), the unemployment rate in France is stable at 9.3% in the metropolis (9.7% in the overseas departments), according to the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee.
The metropolis' unemployment rate stands at 2.631 million.
The second quarter data represented 9.3% of the working age population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
On closer inspection, 3.4 million workers in the French metropolis were unemployed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job, including whether they were active every two weeks or not, or whether they were jobseekers or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate, with an increase of 24.2% in the metropolitan unemployment rate (+ 0.9 percentage points over three months, + 0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% when the overseas regions are included.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people aged 15-24 were unemployed, according to IAA data.
The elderly, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), that is 482,000 people over the age of 50, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office of Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, however, continues in this methodology, announcing on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the Overseas Departments), up from 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini Indicted and Arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône region (PS), is under investigation and imprisoned in Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in connection with public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzlement of corporate assets, embezzlement of public property, theft, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and weapons possession, according to his lawyer.
& quot; Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and plans to express himself on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him, instead of spouting fantasies. & quot;
& quot; It is easy to make a series of criminal charges, it is another thing to prove & quot;, 'his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) ahead of his client' s hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had insisted on sending the judge a memoradum of justification through his lawyers before his hearing.
A relative of Guérin, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday evening.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep going the landfill he had to manage.
He would never have known about the business area of expertise or the destination of the funds involved, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Aubagne Region's Public Service, was also charged on Wednesday with embezzlement and complicity, but was then released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under court supervision.
& quot; My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were alleged to him. & quot;
& quot; The lead prosecutor has taken into account not depriving him of his liberty, said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released from custody Tuesday night, including two under judicial supervision, said Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the waste disposal company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for & quot; unauthorized influence and passive bribery.
Two officials from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have also been arrested, one on charges of complicity in embezzlement of public funds, one on charges of fraud in public office and one on charges of complicity in embezzlement of public funds.
The partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, has also been accused of & quot; theft and embezzlement of & quot;'s corporate assets.
Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of public-sector fraud affecting Corsica, is one of the people to have been confronted by Guérini.
Investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from & quot; high & quot; criminals.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, especially in the waste disposal branch, was conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
According to sources close to the investigation, the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of award and operation of a landfill site at La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne region, as well as from certain cities in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: Elysée Palace exaggerates its role of mediator for Syria
For more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for espionage, captivated the French public, alarmed diplomacy, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper & quot; Le Monde & quot; reveal some background to this crisis.
You describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went as far as to give them advice on dealing with their own crisis of & quot; taking hostages & quot; in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French authorities tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and wanted by the American judiciary for material trafficking in support of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they shine a bright light on the way in which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media to lure credibility to the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
The truth is that he did nothing wrong in that respect.
A telegram sent by diplomats edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 was titled & quot; Iran: French Commentaries on How to Handle Hostage-Taking.
François Richier, Elysée advisor on strategic issues, spoke with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d 'apos; Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
The advised the Americans to do everything possible to return their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
& quot; makes noise & quot;, they said, & quot; articulates loud and clear and incessantly & quot; the words & quot; fundamental human rights & quot;, & quot; innocence & quot;, & quot; immediate release & quot; in the media.
This is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
& quot; Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do this.
Because & quot; silence solves nothing & quot;, passing the discussion attempts about quietly, the Iranians are & quot; masters of evasion & quot;.
Mr Richier adds that detaining foreigners is a common & quot; Iranian tactic: & quot; hostage-taking for political blackmail & quot;
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to take place on 16 August, the day on which she sought refuge in the French Embassy), 'quot; requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians' quot; (EUR 230,000 bail).
And he announced that the Elysée was anticipating more kidnappings, a phenomenon that 'quot; will get worse'.
The Iranians could 'quot; arrest' another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran 'quot; in the near future,' he said.
August 28th, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago but remains detained in Iran.
Information has been circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is being requested by the United States for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material, has been released from prison following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which has been tracking Iran's illegal networks of acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program.
Has France accepted horse-trading?
The liberation of Iran against that of the French woman?
On the occasion of a new discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only taken completely by surprise by the decision of the judge, but also tried to rebel against it.
& quot; There has been a lot of exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but the French Government cannot change the decision of the Court 'quot;,' he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under the strict & quot; supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian 'quot; is currently in the buildings in Paris' managed by the Iranian embassy.
During Clotilde Reiss' custody in Iran, the Elysée did not spare its efforts to make the & quot; escape attempt believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was playing a & quot; important & quot; and & quot; influential role of mediator & quot;.
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony, noting that manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles mirror the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 summoned & quot; to invite the media blitz of the French authorities.
What is the basis for so much & quot; thanksgiving & quot; to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
& quot; Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities privately admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did & quot;.
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to succumb to this fiction.
The intensive communication effort & quot; aims to confirm Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria & quot;, analyses he.
A policy launched in 2008, which was perceived as premature and undeserved by many critics in France and abroad.
& quot; Building the Syrian Role & quot; Try to show Paris & quot; Syria what praise can be gained by playing a constructive role in the region & quot;
It also seeks to sow & quot; discord between Syria and Iran.
The American Embassy knows this well.
On August 11th, François Richier confided to her: & quot; Of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything & quot;
& quot; But we thanked them anyway. & quot;
& quot; This should at least create confusion among Iranians.
Clotilde Reiss will return to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives them at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal, and Syria for their & quot; active role in securing the release of our fellow countryman & quot;.
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called & quot; the Cinderella & quot;, which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by denying them access, officials have indicated.
A bill to require online gaming operators to block under-16s from accessing these games after midnight will be presented to parliament in December, representatives of education and family ministries said.
& quot; Many children play these games all night long, then struggle to learn at school, as well as live a normal day life. & quot;
& quot; We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep, stated Jo Rin, Minister in charge of this draft law for Agence France Presse.
The online games will then be accessible again from 6 a.m. onwards.
Manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he said.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the daily time limit for accessing these games for those youngsters whose parents request them, the official added.
He will also make free programs available to those who wish to limit the amount of time they spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most & quot; networked & quot; countries, and newspapers regularly report on various events involving intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion in worldwide online gaming contests.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, beating 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoint host country
In a great deal of excitement due to suspicions of corruption, the Executive Committee of FIFA on Thursday appointed the countries to host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the wrangling for influence and lobbying threaten to eclipse the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of the supreme discipline of FIFA will be held in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic, with the International Football Federation hoping to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the continent of Africa premiere in 2010, or to continue its presence in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Head of Government of Belgium and Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are thus threatening to continue until the last minute.
Difficult, otherwise, to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which led the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), might as well have ruined the chances of their own country, the cradle of football, being allowed to host the World Cup only once, namely 1966.
The BBC had reignited the debate on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that blasted three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
This is reason enough to annoy FIFA and to embarrass the English officials, who lobbied in the first place David Cameron in these last few weeks.
The PM is hoping to replicate the manoeuvre of his predecessor Tony Blair, who managed to organise the London 2012 Olympics in 2005.
Would this intense effort be enough to restore England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does not lack trumps with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, olympics 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries' economic and financial downsides could dampen their ambitions.
Possible reprisals against the English, as well as doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia becoming a heavyweight outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided to denounce the frank insinuation by the British press that there was' unfair competition 'in the preparation of the vote' quot; by the members of the committee '.
& quot; You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise & quot;, 'Putin ranted.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seem to be the logical favourites.
First Economical World Power, seat of the main sponsors of FIFA, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, who separately have put together a very nice project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that co-organized the 2002 tournament.
Another threat is FIFA's eagerly awaited 2026 World Cup bid for China, which would destroy the Asian chances of hosting the tournament in 2022.
With Australia and Qatar pulling out all the stops with their futuristic stadiums, FIFA are looking to expand to new areas, but these two represent a bigger risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to time difference), the sensitive nerve of FIFA, as acknowledged by European countries.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really trimmed down.
Mitterrand had let it be known that he was unfaithful.
Valéry Giscard d 'apos; Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate in the slightest.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than these.
One mandate in the Elysée invokes the next.
The current leader will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not sit well with the side of the mystery inherent in the presidential function.
So one has to act as if there is doubt from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without their own belief in it.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy affirmed in a serious tone that he would make his decision & quot; sometime in the autumn of 2011.
There had been some feverish talk in the Elysée on Tuesday night, in front of the UMP MPs, about the prospect of winning two seats.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It is not the first time he has used a humorous tone to refer to the presidential election at such gatherings.
& quot; At best, you have seven-and-a-half more years with me, or at best, & quot;, 'he told them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: & quot; Do n 't think that I will not reflect on the phase after that. & quot;
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the day before; but no less.
If they generate comments, it is for two reasons.
Speeding up the race to become a PS candidate on one page.
However, it is not the start of the competition with Ségolène Royal that drives Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012 that many PS members are warning him to fight earlier than expected.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% vs. 44%, according to the BVA-L & apos; Express).
& quot; We have a candidate, and there is no discussion whatsoever with the UMP about & quot; responded immediately and cautiously to the environment of the Prime Minister.
& quot; If he decided defeat was possible, he would not be a candidate & quot;, informs Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
& quot; He will always believe he can win & quot; corrects Alain Juppé, who has resigned himself to the obvious.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB's Governing Council last year should provide an opportunity to show ways to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges the Central Bank in Frankfurt, undoubtedly, cannot afford to forfeit even today's more than tense situation on the European bond markets, lest it exacerbate it.
The political cost would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, speaking at a press conference yesterday, welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving Europe' s sovereign debt.
It did not say whether it thought the Central Bank could do more, for example by relaunching its programme of government bond purchases.
& quot; I reserve my rights for my European trading partners (...) & quot;
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, on the previous day in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, was not very eloquent about his intentions, but was content to point out that the programme of government securities purchases would continue & quot; on the secondary market, and that at the meeting on Thursday we will see how the decisions turn out & quot;.
The only certainty is that the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, historically the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB's bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled last week to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And, according to indiscretions by some traders, yesterday she was reported to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities.
Total purchases by the Eurosystem's central banks since May 2010 totals EUR 67 billion.
There is no doubt among traders about the anticipation of follow-up of the purchase price (see page 29).
Economists do not expect a marked change in rates any time soon.
When the bonds of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB' s will still make use of the unrestricted funds reserves in a generous way, for a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already expecting this measure to extend for a few more months.
& quot; I cannot imagine that the ECB will modify its programme substantially, & quot;.
& quot; Otherwise, it risks provoking new tensions in the short term, surmises Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
& quot; A phasing-out date for the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely, & quot; anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the & quot; sovereign debt market, the ECB should maintain such a bond-buying volume that stimulates the sluggish market, adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the relevance of the exposure of European banks in the sovereign debt markets of the Eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
& quot; must go to the sellers of the under-investors in the market at all costs, and act in such a way as to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the yields paid to the weakest sovereigns. & quot;, testified a major bondholder yesterday.
This is because if interest rates soar, governments will be even more prevented from reducing, or even stabilising, their debts.
This is the price for protecting the Euro.
Berlusconi's government is taking cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, things eased somewhat yesterday with the fall of the benchmark 10-year interest rate.
A return to deceptive silence.
By the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the President of the Region, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as' quot; indecipherable & quot; ', and had heard him calculate a' quot; unpredictable '-weekend, which he immediately denied.
On Tuesday, the spread of German interest rates would have hit its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts covering bankruptcy risk would have risen to 263 points, causing some headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed grave concern as & quot; about the market turbulence & quot; and the possible threat of contagion from Ireland.
& quot; The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland. & quot;
& quot; The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal, explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated dwindling tax revenues, which put the state in danger of being unable to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the Government.
Going forward, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget under consideration in the Senate expects 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these circumstances, the EU Commission calculates that next year's budget deficit will still be 4.3% of GDP (against the government' s forecast of 3.9%) and 3.5% of GDP in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar surrounding a new budgetary collective that could be mobilised after the holidays for a sum of EUR 7 billion.
& quot; New Austerity Measures Must Be Introduced if Needed, Accountant Olli Rehn Says
At the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
& quot; The foundations of the Italian economy are in order and its accounts are in order, & quot; we have been repeating this for a long time, assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
& quot; There are no problems at the moment, either in the short term or in the long term, because Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), is being asked to make less stabilisation progress than other countries, observes Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief Economist at the OECD.
The question remains is the political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure from the Chamber of Deputies, meaning that the early elections could be held as early as the end of March.
So there is an unfavourable period ahead for a decision on a major crisis.
Europeans reflect on stepping up anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it explicit yesterday at a press conference in Paris: & quot; I think we proved it again on Sunday afternoon and again in the evening: Europeans stand united, they are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area & quot;.
Although perfectly relative, the deduction in the interest rates of the European sovereign bonds recorded yesterday was water on the windmills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, there is no sign yet of a normalization beginning.
The rating agency Standard & amp; Poor & apos; announced that it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
& quot; As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which weigh heavily on the banking systems, according to economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since political time passes much more slowly than that of the markets.
The European countries, which are well aware of both the gulf and the danger that lies in it, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures that already exist.
Informal consultations between the Finance Ministers most directly affected, and more broadly with their G20 counterparts, are progressing well.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
The plan focuses on the fate of unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of the eurozone countries in the markets' crosshairs (see below).
Concerning the EU Stability Funds, its Executive Director Klaus Regling already started his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore, in order to inform investors in the Far East about developments concerning the crisis in Europe.
If his visit is not about explicit fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
First promotional paper editions from the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters that the United States was supporting a possible increase in funds mobilized by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the front line, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular in the area of the organization of the labour market.
Reforms that should be on top of the austerity measures, but will have an impact in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid will take a different path than Greece and Ireland have taken.
At all costs, it is important for both parties to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have drawn up their own budget adjustments and decided on essential structural reforms that will restore their confidence in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are discussing the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to go back into its own pocket.
The economists of Barclays Capital, the leading player in the European sovereign debt market, consider that a prolongation of around 100 billion euros would be enough, & quot; preferably in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This tool exists: the European mechanism of financial stabilization, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
An advisory board that has every chance of being scrutinised closely in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions deteriorate.
Snow and black ice: 24 Departments on Orange Alert
The episodes of snow continue to cause traffic difficulties, in particular on Brittany's secondary transport networks, and threaten to affect a variety of economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on orange alert due to the risk of snow and freezing temperatures.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already on Orange alert; 18 since Wednesday afternoon, and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, the heavy snow showers affect the north of Gironde as well as the Charentes; it snows lightly on et Ile-de-France.
Snow cover of 2 to 5 cm is expected in the affected departments, in places also 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Parisian region.
The regions affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d 'apos; Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Snow falls are significant enough to cause traffic disruption and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the region of Côtes d 'apos; Armor several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult according to the traffic police, who do not recommend using your vehicle only in an emergency situation, and the use of some TER coaches was cancelled for the whole day.
School traffic in Picardy was suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture of & quot; urges drivers to take extreme care on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly. & quot;
On Thursday, the Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel 25% of flights departing from Roissy Airport in Paris and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airport in south London, as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about modernising the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
Remember, in particular, the $23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the construction of SGP, the state has proclaimed a capital envelope of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that SGP would then allow to lend a portion of the financial sum at twice its value on the markets.
Today, the first extrapolations finally came to fruition.
The 2010 Supplementary Budget, reviewed this morning by the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of this money.
There are two types of tax: a special tax for development and a higher tax on Ile-de-France's offices.
The former, as Article 15 of the draft law suggests, goes to Société du Grand Paris & quot;.
This is quantified: & quot; The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year & quot;.
The second is a reorganization of the existing corporate taxation: & quot; to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it, and to entrust this increase to & quot; of the Société du Grand Paris.
How much would this bring in?
A puzzle.
This sum is not given in the text.
One is far away from the 4 billion.
& quot; It is explained that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion Euro of capital endowment raised by the state and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project & quot;, as explained in the explanatory statement.
In the case of SGP, you do not find this system offensive at all.
& quot; Since the moment when you record revenue (the two taxes, that is to say, the general rule), you can cover the project for three years and then draw on the $4 billion, it explains.
& quot; This is noted in the budget and gradually withdrawn.
The SGP estimates that in 2013, it will begin to write down the $4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions can be found for a long time, runs the risk of provoking quite an animated parliamentary debate.
The first public session will take place on 7 December.
Vindictive Hackers and Diligent Spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a dual meaning.
On one hand, it has proved to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is nothing but a scandal of Sinner hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at an international level, and gives a foretaste of the regression-dominated future.
But let's go one at a time.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an secret service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
The & quot; extraordinary & quot;, American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits yield nothing more than what was read for months in every other journal for months anyway (except those owned by Berlusconi), and the horribly caricatured profile of Gadhafi provided for cabaret artists for a long time material for their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only consist of news already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will see that each work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templar or the Rosary) repeats exactly what has been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism believe in nothing more than what they already know, confirming what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise, the Secret Files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or restricted in spirit) is also the chief of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example, the editor of Libération), who only considers what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as that that Newsweek published the week before.
So why was there such a fuss made over the disclosures in these files?
On one page, they state what every educated person already knows, namely that embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since then even the Heads of Government have been able to call each other or to take a plane to meet for dinner - the embassies have lost their diplomatic function and have turned, with the exception of a few small representational tasks, into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore this.
Nevertheless, the fact of repeating it in public violates the vocation of hypocrisy, and serves to cast American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-factor hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world deals a major blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Moreover, the scandal brings distress to the & quot; executioner, rather than the victims.
But let's focus on the more profound nature of what happened.
Once, in Orwell's day, you could pool all your power like a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have been proved perfectly correct since then, when you can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction done, the hotel visited, the highway chosen, and so on; the citizen would become a total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one considers what is happening today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control corridor ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
True, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi's or Merkel' s character is basically a secret free of secrecy, since it divulges the public sphere; but to reveal, WikiLeaks-style, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to strip them of all power.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but it has wronged Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this insult inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future, States will no longer put any reserved information online - it would be like putting a notice on a street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies, it is futile to hope to be able to keep confidential reports about telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than knowing if and when a Head of State has travelled on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could we maintain private relationships in the future that are only for certain ears?
I am well aware that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romanticism, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents secretly pacing themselves along uncontrollable routes, carrying their communications nowhere but in their bare memory, and also hiding the few written pieces of information they have received in their shoe heel.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the espionage attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today technology is advancing like a cancer, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, by winding from back to front and revealing all the secrets of the montage, whereas nowadays the (numerical) CDs allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, in macro portions.
High-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan in three hours, while flying takes three and a half hours, including connecting flights.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to the car and the horse.
A last observation.
In former times the press tried to understand what secrets were forged between the embassies.
At the moment, it is the embassies requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is beautifying its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to investigate compliance with the fast-moving funding promises (also known as & quot; Fast Start & quot; or Early Financing) made by developing countries.
And already rude French gossip has been exposed.
Under the Copenhagen Accord, developing countries committed to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, while France has promised €1.26 billion (€420 million per annum).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to Fast Start financing: detailed procedure report of its Member States, press conference, major side-events, distribution of brochures.
Operation Transparency is remarkable, and is valued precisely for its inherent value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces to have released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, putting it on the right track to pay respect to its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money, according to the Copenhagen Treaty, should be 'new' and 'additional' in order to ensure that an extra contribution was made without being to the detriment of ODA.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what & quot; means new and additionally & quot;.
While the EU Commission proposed harmonization, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone selects the benchmark that they think is best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen the benchmark for 2009: to maintain international funding, adding & quot; Fast-Start funding worth 150 million over three years.
Other countries have adopted similar benchmarks, either in terms of years or in terms and conditions at ODA level.
In return, France considered the funding of all new & quot; projects of 2010 to be 'new' and in addition 'quot;'.
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the previous year's expenditure or for ODA at global level.
Specifically, the total amount of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or decrease) - France claims to be honouring its commitment to provide both new and additional & quot; financing.
Another, crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule over this yet, and everyone selects their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 borrowed €as the equivalent of 1 donated €.
Obviously, it is difficult to defend: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often carbon mitigation projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceitful to present the Euro as the equivalent of one donated Euro... Moreover, only the cost of the loan to the donor country should be counted as the commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing but the following consideration: it & quot; respects its commitment of 420 million euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5% (36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to see for itself.
France is the only EU country to use large-scale loans.
Germany is charging 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are paying 100% in donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France gives just 10 cents, which is a comparable amount.
Beautiful hocus pocus!
In short, France is operating a double fraud in its Fast Start funding: one part is the evolution of the action over time, and the other is the reality of the financial commitment.
France manages to make us believe that it has spent 420 million euros, new and additional, in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros.
Manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who conducted the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once inside the EU (why do the other member states continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question in a relatively short period of time compared to the totality of discussions on climate.
But it might be one drop too many in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Be that as it may, it is imperative to learn the lesson of this first year of premature funding.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its way of posting for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could advance the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another crucial topic currently being discussed): it cannot escape the question of the transferability of loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive on the issues as it is on other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about the Fast-Start of France and its vision of & quot; accountability & quot; as well as the use of loans would by its very nature raise the international confidence level that is necessary for further discussion.
Alarm - Child-ingested Pesticides
A child of 10 years of age consumes 81 different chemicals over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement for the protection of the rights and respect for generations to come).
The association, which declares that its results do not reflect a statistically significant value due to the small number of samples analyzed, but are an illustration of the problematic matter discussed, purchased the food usually consumed by a child of approximately 10 years with meals plus a snack at supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh pieces of fruit and fruit, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were studied as well as snacking by laboratories in search of chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The dish balance is devastating: 81 chemicals, including 42 possibly or likely carcinogenic and five safely carcinogenic, as well as 37 endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
& quot; Even though, in the approximate totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical substance taken individually are not exceeded, it is quite clear from this survey that the reality of consumers potentially being exposed to carcinogenic substances or endocrine disruptor is a cause for concern, & quot; notes the association.
At breakfast time alone, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues, three of the residues are safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than 20 residues that can affect the endocrine system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, for which the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
There were also minced steak, canned tuna, even baguette and chewing gum covered in pesticides and other chemicals.
In the case of tap water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the & quot; richest with 34 detected chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unencumbered.
The risk of this' quot; pollutant cocktail 'to the consumer' quot; is likely to be undervalued ', the study found.
For its part, the & quot; Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts & quot; (EE-LV), in view of the urgency of the situation, has proposed to & quot; introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to halt the & quot; epidemic of diseases affecting civilization.
In July, a study conducted by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on the presence of residues identified 365 different pesticides found in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
