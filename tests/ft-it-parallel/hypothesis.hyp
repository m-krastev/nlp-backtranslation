The audio quality of Vorbis is better measured not in kilobits per second, but on a quality scale of -1 to 10. Quality -1 corresponds to approximately 45 KBit / sec., 5 is approximately 160 KBit / sec., and 10 results in approximately 400 KBit / sec. CD-related quality is achieved approximately at level 5, lossless stereo compression is achieved approximately at level 6. The default is 3, which achieves approximately 110 KBit / sec., and significantly smaller files with better quality than.mp3 with 128 KBit / sec.
