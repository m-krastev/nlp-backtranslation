A loan is an agreement in which a borrower receives money from a lender and agrees to pay the money back at a later date. & kappname; allows you to track loans where you are the lender and have lent money, or where you as a borrower have taken out a loan. Most private individuals take out loans rather than lend money, so you are usually the borrower and a financial institution is the lender. If you lend money to a family member or friend, you can of course use & kappname; to do this.
