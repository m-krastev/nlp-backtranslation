What should it do, the ČSSD? Czech Social Democrats in Prague do n 't know Voldemort, nor the & quot; patisserie & quot;.
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD ranks will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has tapped members of the new ČSSD council once a little & quot; on how to master the notorious slang, which has become naturalized in recent years, where today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the elapsed era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the most famous actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are a bit in the dark about which these new terms should be used.
That's what they claim.
& quot; Who is Voldemort? & quot;
& quot; clueless. & quot;
& quot; I am rather a newcomer to Prague politics & quot;, reacted Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for culture, to the test of the & quot; godfather's vocabulary.
But also the councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, on the & quot; golhole & quot;.
& quot; This is the only expression of those you submit to me here. I use it every now and then. & quot;
& quot; otherwise, I do n 't much of slang. & quot;
From the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuálně.cz in June this year, before the ODS election congress, the editors picked six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists and Democrats should define the terms & quot; Voldemort & quot;, & quot; largest Prague golf hole & quot;, & quot; go to the pastry shop & quot;, & quot; bullnecks & quot;, & quot; treachery of the capital & quot; and & quot; bleach & quot;.
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - first promised to participate in the interview, but then did not even accept the receiver.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the start.
& quot; These things matter to me and how the commonwealth democrats talk to each other, I do n 't judge by that. & quot;
& quot; For me, the important thing is how we understand ourselves in the context of our programs & quot;, he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký would not have allegedly recognized in the above-mentioned headline that there was talk of the influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-Lord Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term & quot; Voldemort & quot; tells Kaucky purely nothing and the only term he guessed correctly when testing was & quot;'s biggest Prague golf hole & quot;.
& quot; This is the tunnel Blanka & quot; says Kaucký, but added for security: & quot; But I know that more from the newspaper. & quot;
And jokingly: & quot; I 'll probably have to take a language course. & quot;
The & quot; golf hole & quot; will then be deciphered correctly as Tunnel Blanka, not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by Councillor for Environmental Affairs Lukáš Plachý.
However, both social democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for. Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found, and thereby also what it means to go & quot; into the pastry shop.
& quot; I think that means to go into some Prague gastronomy business & quot;, Plachý is pretty close to solving the puzzle if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's firms.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserts to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than having this vocabulary his own.
Judging from the test participants, there does indeed seem to be no similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
& quot; I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us. & quot;
& quot; We call each other by name. Every now and then we also use abbreviations or nicknames & quot;, says Prague ČSSD Chairman Petr Hulínský - called salopp & quot; Hulda & quot; by his party comrades.
& quot; In school I was called Bříza (Birch), but I do n 't know if my colleagues call me that & quot;, Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz tried out the name and see here - it works.
Councilman Weinert is friendly to the party members of the & quot; Opa; & quot; or less friendly to the & quot; Old & quot;, the representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention before the election by machinations in party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues & quot; Igráček & quot; (well-known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only thing the Social Democrats allow in intra-party parlance.
Hulínský is said to dislike it when called & quot; Hulda & quot;, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another Prague chairman's nickname.
His nickname & quot; doctor of rubber trunk rights & quot; is said to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský acquired his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of & quot; witches & quot; and issued a pamphlet
Women who are branded as witches in Burkina Faso usually share some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation. They cannot find a job - for example, for health reasons, they are single and do not have children.
When one of these women becomes the witch & quot; becomes & quot;. She is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
& quot; men are quite seldom affected by this fate. & quot;
& quot; Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with work and give birth to children. & quot;, a nun describes the situation in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, in a special home for more than one hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal & quot; social measure.
And issued a pamphlet for that reason, which is meant to stop the & quot; witch hunt & quot;.
But there is a catch.
& quot; More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read & quot;, pointed out the newspaper & quot; of the Standard & quot; on the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is common practice in other African countries, too.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbouring country, Ammy Hemmahová, 27, was tortured to death by three women and two men - who doused her in petroleum and simply set her on fire.
The incident was also reported by the BBC server, among others.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the affair was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointing.
This is after the group tried to exorcise & quot; an evil spirit of & quot; from the woman & quot;.
The isolation of & quot; witches & quot; supports the people here regardless of their education.
& quot; The Standard & quot; quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso to this effect. & quot; eaters of human souls are a danger & quot;, he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, last year the Gambian President did the President himself neatly.
& quot; President Yahya Jammeh unleashed a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt. The latter allegedly had a share in their deaths and would now try to kill the President himself through black magic. & quot;
& quot; To do this, he called for help from shamans from nearby Guinea, who, accompanied by policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, forcibly abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president' s farm in Kanilai, the organization Amnesty International cited in its report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink a decoction of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the locked people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bakala: he heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly stocky man is just leaving the Client Center of the RPG Byty company of the & quot; coal baron & quot; Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm, a portfolio of three new leases on three apartments: for his own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just had their rent increased as part of the so-called & quot; deregulation & quot;.
Instead of 3500 kronor monthly rent, the son is to fork 4100 kronor in the next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
& quot; And there is not even running hot water in the apartment. You have to heat in a simple coal oven & quot;, he angrily taps his finger on the son's new lease of lease. He has a power of attorney to sign.
& quot; But what - I signed & quot;, he declares, half-upset and half-resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new rental terms and conditions as & quot; incorrectly and immorally & quot;, advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts, and to wait until December 7th, when it plans to publish a guide on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man is only waving away.
& quot; one says this, the other the & quot;, it makes a sinister face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming the great & quot; deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants so far do not pay market-appropriate rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this & quot; lab & quot; in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already at nine o 'clock in the morning this Tuesday is breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with them a call device.
& quot; rented 2011 & quot;, so a special keypad on the touchscreen will shine.
Short tapped and already the device spits out a numbered sheet.
Barely have we undeciphered the number & quot; 157 & quot; and already it beeps on the large display at the ceiling of the waiting room.
It is your turn half a second later.
A little later an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent. But the rush in the waiting room apparently is not for the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues, and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new leases will fly into the letterboxes of most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio.
The RPG Byty proposes to them in the letters a rent increase of approximately 15 to 38 per cent.
The special switch for the new rents in the Client Centre has been open since 18 November.
& quot; The action runs a little over a week, that is, this is just the beginning of & quot;. The ladies behind the switch answer after a moment of hesitation as the & quot; client turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miner' s homes are a hot topic.
Before the elections, the Ostrava-born parliamentary vice-president, Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD, had raised this issue quite loudly. No wonder newspapers are full of it today.
& quot; twenty years I want from them a new floor. & quot;
& quot; Not even ne besh. Toilet goggles they could replace. & quot;, the man mentioned in the beginning makes himself air.
So far, according to the staff, especially retirees are waiting at the counter to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenant reduction, which RPG promises them if they sign the special offer on time.
The remaining tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December should also benefit from a half-off February rent.
So far, & quot; is the deregulation switch & quot; in Havířov is anything but overloaded with requests.
& quot; only about 40 to 50 of yesterday's 360 clients were of the rent in 2011 because of here & quot;, the counter clerks estimate.
RPG thereby offers individual lease arrangements, where necessary, both on their websites, as well as wall panels.
However, if the leasing parties fail to agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
& quot; This is not to be a threat. It is to be understood as information about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal course of action, & quot; explains RPG on its web pages.
& quot; Here no one goes to court & quot;, says one of the staff of RPG Byty. A man on the street in front of the client center proves her at least partially right.
& quot; I have 13,000 (kronor) pension, of which I have 5,000 left for food. Where should I get the money for a court dispute & quot;;.
Then the employee becomes unsafe after all.
& quot; Mal see. & quot;
& quot; Mr. Zaorálek tells them via the media not to sign and so people are still waiting for & quot;, gives them to consider.
Regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year '2011' and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
& quot; The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund & quot;, argues Pavel Klimeš, director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty. - It is precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the enraged tenants that is the main reason for the rent increase according to the landlords.
While RPG could invest 4 billion in the apartments in the years between 2005 and 2010 from the rents taken, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it should invest 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered chairs in the waiting room at Havířov, a few information that shines in red repeatedly pops up in between.
& quot; The rent increases of 15% and less in 2011 affect 31,200 flats, which is more than 90% of the flats of RPG. & quot;
& quot; Always, this means no more than 7.50 CZK per square foot per month & quot; is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG the rent increases by 38 per cent.
& quot; In these cases, it's about raising extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square foot & quot;, argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments, rents will remain at the same level for the next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not push rents up by leaps and bounds, but will be phased in over four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes another obligation on itself: Any income from the rent increase (see chart) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - primarily, these are intended to benefit those people who sign the tenancy increase agreements.
The architects looked in - the office also has a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furnishings, a lot of toys and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The design and architecture firm Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole range of well-known Brno buildings originated, calculated from the very first designs for the new Avriopoint building on the premises for its corporate mini-kindergarten.
Wise foresight, because most of its 90 staff are baby boomers, and the company is keen for the project- and architects to return to work as quickly as possible.
Along with being able to work shortened, kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
This makes it easier for the building engineers and architects to reconcile their demanding careers and child care.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the staff of Arch.Design. With the support of management, they succeeded in winning grants from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company's mini-kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from funds of the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants of CZK 2.8 million) it was possible to procure the necessary facilities and equipment. Qualified personnel and operation is provided for a duration of 2 years.
After the funds have been exhausted (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue running the mini-kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
Preparing this project took an entire year, with the Economy Rating company providing active assistance in application processing.
Children are looked after full-time by qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher. Children can attend kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at a time, however, alternate throughout the day across multiple children.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly tuned to the needs of the parents. The children of all employees have the same rights regarding the use of the kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is about individual education and care, the contents of the program at the mini-kindergarten are nevertheless comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here. Above all, they are provided with excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to pre-school instruction, along the way they learn English as well.
The classroom is equipped not only with toys and creative games, but also with a calculator available to the children.
What's more - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
Parents can have a look at the children at any time. This eliminates the stress of late pick-up of children from a far-flung kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also formed here.
Arch.Design thus ranked among the Czech companies that provide significant benefits when recruiting new employees. These benefits are family-friendly, and they empower their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house is still fascinating after 100 years. Take a look at Gaudi's interiors
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase looks like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are ripped open fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló designed by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname & quot; Bonehead & quot;.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile splints and mosaics, the shed-like façades and ubiquitous soft lines. These are all typical features of Antonio Gaudi's Art Nouveau style.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures that recall nature and living beings.
Only on closer inspection can one notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm, and thoughtful order.
At night, the whole facade looks even more three-dimensional, dramatic and the special illumination enhances the brilliance of the colours even more.
The same sweeping lines and intertwined forms also dominate the interior of the house.
Wavy shaped timber copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, yes even peepholes and moldings.
The Batlló house, located in the Eixample neighbourhood on the busy Passeig de Grácia no. 43 shopping street, was created through the reconstruction of an 1877 house, carried out by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of a completely new one. But in the end he agreed with Gaudí's idea for an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló apartment building was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked together with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was precisely on his drawing board that the decorations for the representative dwelling of the owner of reality were created. Also the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea.
However, numerous other visual artists and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
Working together on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá in Güell Park, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Already shortly after its completion the house got the nickname & quot; bone house from the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others called it the special window opening mechanism because of the & quot; yawning house & quot;.
It is also said that at the very top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolise hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house at the time with ventilation ducts and typical fireplaces.
Their 45 degree inclination already sounds a bit bizarre.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of that time and by no means succumbed to them.
Before construction started, he did obtain the appropriate building permit from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city's fathers were so appalled by the result when it was completed two years later that they demanded a remedy.
Among other things, the councillors clashed with the fact that the building, with its pillars, even interfered with the public sidewalk.
However, changes have not been made. On the contrary, just fifteen days after the neighborhood's request to this effect, Josep Batlló submitted an application for authorization to lease the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social room, on the 3rd floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor has been leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-story building passes through a staircase up to the rooftop.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines, replacing them with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept of connecting spaces together.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, and so a larger company could chat comfortably without having to forego a certain intimacy for more confidential conversations.
The house received a rather unusual roof and two more floors as a result of Gaudí's conversion, apart from a new facade.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with light, as well as the blue and white glazed tiles that cover the courtyard and the courtyards of light.
The play of these two colours gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, which was inscribed into the World Heritage List by UNESCO in 2005, can be visited by everyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and sumptuous apartment is made accessible to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year to this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was realized that this is a fairly lucrative business, the viewings were retained. In fact, they were also extended to further common and attic rooms, including the rooftop.
The price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard box, however. It is 16.50 euros. Students, retirees, groups and holders of tourist cards get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance prices to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get acquainted with the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon turrets, you should try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and bed rack? Women have different wishes than men
Not the nicest bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, size, state of health and, last but not least, the sleeper's sex.
Equally important is the interior, where mattress and grate have to be subordinated.
Typical Example?
In a weekend house that does not heat up regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited. They take much longer to warm & quot; up & quot;.
In addition, they are considerably heavier than standard polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned periodically.
If they do not have enough venting tubes in the core and they are still on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that mould will form beneath them.
Of course, what you are accustomed to also plays a role in the election.
Those who have been abroad for a longer period of time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it difficult to get accustomed to a low mattress with a hard surface.
& quot; Probably all hockey players who have returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can 't sleep properly here anymore. & quot;
& quot; For their worn-off shoulders, heels, and hips, they simply need a soft layer of viscisco foam. & quot;
& quot; This I recommend, among other things, also people with diabetes, who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they are ill-equipped to receive the & quot; information from the joints and skin. & quot; specializes in upholstered furniture, explains Sylva Hadamcziková.
That's why I got these memory foam mattresses years ago for many hockey players, but also for other customers.
& quot; Today, this is no longer a problem. Such mattresses are offered by, among others, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex, or the Czech manufacturer Tropico. & quot;
And you don 't necessarily need to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of viscisco foam.
This & quot; miracle & quot; actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally adheres to the warm body.
Nowhere squeezes it. At night you do n 't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (gangrene).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles of the feet to the body height, so approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Man like woman, who are about 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available, so a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of convenience and also for eventual visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: & quot; If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms & quot;, advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators. She has devoted herself for years to the issues of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and also lectures this topic at specialist schools.
With a double bed everyone needs their own grate and their own mattress, but watch out when shopping so that the mattresses are equally high too.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grates at different heights. This is by no means possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with a spring skeleton should be 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be allocated to the mold layer and the fine cushion.
& quot; By hand or while sitting down, you must not under any circumstances feel the springs & quot;, Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Full-upholstered beds with mattress and mattress backing, such as conjoined Siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and you cannot wash the cover, which is already commonplace today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it's clear that after five to seven years, the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged) sieve.
Also for this reason, specialists reject advertising slogans, which promise a life of up to 25 years, even life-long warranty with mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: for mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, one should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, yet it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily peeled and washed.
Although nowadays, as a rule, mattress covers are made with a full-length zip, so that after opening you get two halves (immensely important for the wash and machine size!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often feels like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a rust?
Get out of there!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, you should prefer to use the panel with ventilation holes (provided there are none in there already) and mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 spring bars (lamellae) latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut). Thereby, slats always pay off with a larger number of lattes, that is 28 or more spring bars, with lumbar support in the lumbar area and the possibility to regulate the lateral hardness.
Adjustable laminated grates do not include spring-mounted mattresses, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to setting the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is about a special attachment of the spring strips. It allows to press the spring strips or even to bend them so that they allow the selective sinking of the sleeper's shoulder.
Especially for wide-shouldered men, an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using & quot; gentlemen'mattresses with & quot; soft zones for the shoulder area.
Also thought of the ladies - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing springs (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multi-torsion springs are intended.
The pressure is distributed to several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and bulky) pillow for the right mattress and rust, most of the benefits will be lost again.
Again a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach as far as the shoulders, so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion, as the Scandinavians, for example, like it, appears ideal.
In the lateral position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Something our modern mattresses have in common with the former (hay filled) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magic word is called & quot; Bio & quot;.
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used to produce polyurethane foams - for example, castor and soybean oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
& quot; Bio in the case of mattresses means that their core is composed of materials of purely natural origin, & quot; explains Petr Vašíček of the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of mattress covers. One of the first was Aloe Vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules, which spread fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
Again, one makes a distinction between man and woman.
While for men, a & quot; cooling & quot; plant extract made of birch leaves is used to allow the mattress cover to absorb the heat and cool the body, for women, the covers have a warming & quot; effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets pleasantly warm when sleeping.
And today's favourites?
Cold foam mattresses (it has larger pores with a destroyed cell structure, making it more breathable than commercial polyurethane, and also much more flexible).
By combining the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and Visco foams, you can create multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where your head, hips and heels are.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have to shell out 7000 crowns or more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with less VAT, as they are considered to be medical aids.
This advantage was given to Gumotex as the first Czech company.
You can see, saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers offering two mattresses at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with the Memory Quilted Visco foam cover for CZK 11,990.
You get the second one for free.
It was the Tempur material that ushered in the era of visco-elastic foams with an open cell structure and high density, at an almost cosmic tempo.
No wonder, since they were designed for NASA. The astronauts are subjected to enormous overloading during launches.
Tempur becomes soft at heat, in cool surroundings it solidifies again.
This way it perfectly adapts to the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but generally increases sleep comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are intended to provide relief for the legs and the vessels.
For example, local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people-monitoring devices to keep kids under control
Fear for your own children is growing, and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented to search cars, can actually locate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box but soon it's unlikely to be any bigger than a watch.
Many people have been terrified by the case of the missing Anička, so they are on the lookout for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an infringement of their privacy.
& quot; We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying at all. It is an effective means of reducing the probability of a tragedy occurring & quot;. Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS positioning devices on the Czech market, points out.
& quot; I admit that there can be misuse of such devices in individual cases, for example when you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing about it. But we have not yet had a case like this registered. & quot; has not registered any such devices.
& quot; most customers really buy it for security reasons & quot;, Pilin adds.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what the purpose of the & quot; box & quot; is and how to use it in case of emergencies.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that when a child does not like to wear such a thing, they simply get rid of it.
& quot; Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things on purpose, when they do n 't want to be controlled. & quot;
& quot; Already the mobile phones raised great expectations with the parents at the beginning, but they can be turned off just as easily as these new monitoring devices & quot;, says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in case of an attack.
& quot; With planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always checks if the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate him. & quot;
& quot; Today it is the mobile phone. & quot;
& quot; If such monitoring devices found broader use, they would seek this as well, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive publicity. & quot;
& quot; In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police, & quot; says.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the event of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which provides location services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
& quot; The device can be set to report the respective position at certain intervals. & quot;
& quot; Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available. & quot;
& quot; For more expensive devices, even an inclinometer is built in. This means that if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning stating the position & quot;, claims Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do smart mobile phones with navigation, you just need to install special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that they are either match-box sized devices that resemble trailers, or smaller mobile phones.
Always in this way, there is a danger of losing them.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, this is why you are currently testing devices that look like normal digital clocks.
& quot; This has the advantage that the eventual attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a monitoring / locating device.
& quot; or he will notice this only after some time has passed. This gives the police a time lead & quot;, he adds.
No matter what direction the evolution is going - towards bracelets or pendants, always the same technology is used as for vehicle locating.
So to combine the location function using the GPS system (same as with the car navigation system) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many cables that you could wrap all over the Czech Republic you could hold but only two years
The Czech Army has purchased 445 kilometres of fuses to be used to detonate IEDs.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of detonation cord to the army camps.
It is quite reassuring to know that the Armed Forces have worked for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but no more than four years.
The Army bought the fuses from the stock corporation STV Group, a. s. for a paltry 40 million kronor.
In his justification for purchasing this enormous amount of fuse, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume approximately 60 kilometers of fuse per year.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians MF DNES responded to this, this statement states that the whole army would have to undergo an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the Army Command, to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not exempted.
Only in this way can the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of cords be reasonably justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations by the way.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
If, however, the old expert rule still holds that for the training of each new professional soldier two meters of fuse are completely sufficient, then by these new purchases - also in view of the increased need of the Pioneers and Special Units - has created for itself a reassuring reserve for the already mentioned 225 years.
While doing so, soldiers of the Quick Deployment Brigade recently complained to the Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no cartridges left for handguns, so shooting drills are severely limited because of the lack of resources.
Not to mention the underpants shortage.
& quot; does not address to me why they are buying such huge amounts of cords from us. & quot;
But this is ultimately their decision. They will already know to what they need it. & quot;
& quot; For us, the Army is a good customer, and we as dealers want to come as close as possible to & quot;;, says STV Group sales manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defence, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of fuse by saying that this way the army has covered itself with this & quot; ammunition & quot; for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký of STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year usage period of the lines and police and army pyrotechnicians even of two years.
& quot; If stored perfectly, the four years mentioned are probably also possible, & quot; admits one of them, who, however, wants to remain unnamed, so as not to be accused of criticising the army.
After the duration has expired, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not put soldiers' lives at risk.
However, these tests are not free of charge. They cost additional money.
Another Defense Department argument is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition.
& quot; You cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers of & quot;, spokesman Pejšek tells us the Defense Department purchaser' s point of view.
Just for comparison, annual consumption of cords from police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from World War II or the Soviet Brotherhood army has barely exceeded 1,500 metres for some years now.
And the police always only order such quantities of this ammunition, which they can consume even before the use period has expired.
Already for the safety of the pyrotechnicians, besides, one keeps open the possibility for flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignitions.
The Ministry of Defense already has huge problems in winding up tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-strong Czechoslovakian People's Army was preparing to launch its campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians who spoke to MF DNES, in a few years the Czech Armed Forces will face the same problem of liquidation of hundreds of kilometres of old fuses, which they bought so & quot; cheap & quot; today.
To date, the contacts I have gained thanks to the contest have suited me
Winning placement in the & quot; Small Business Entrepreneur of the Year & quot; competition helped Lukáš Pytloun sell his hotel's franchise.
Last year's winner of the & quot; Small Entrepreneur of the Year competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success sounds like a movie scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he realized that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
Using the savings from his holidays abroad and a bank loan he bought a dilapidated house with five flats.
Given that he was a sixth-semester college student at the time, this was certainly a bold move.
& quot; The price / quality ratio at that time annoyed me, so I tried to do something about it & quot;, says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented out the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately re-invested all the profit into the house, which he then converted step by step into a 54 bed retirement.
Since then, in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has succeeded in opening four guesthouses, two style-oriented restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four star hotel & quot; Pytloun Design Hotel & quot;.
Another first class hotel was added this year.
& quot; has just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé. We have sold our franchise concept to them and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotels franchise have already registered. & quot;, says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
& quot; had a big share in this licensing sale to operate hotels just winning the & quot; Entrepreneur of the Year & quot; competition, adds Mr Pytloun appreciatively.
Victory has given him greater prominence, yes popularity, in Liberec and its surroundings.
& quot; People recognized me on the street, often congratulating me even after the event and I have to say this did really well & quot; remembers.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to take part in this contest.
You don 't need to win right away either, any visibility is good.
He says that he is still benefiting today from the contacts and acquaintances that would not have happened otherwise.
& quot; With some people I have met thanks to the contest, I still maintain regular business relationships to this day. & quot;
In his opinion, the fame associated with success also has a little impact on each of his employees.
And since he has about seventy.
& quot; I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that gets universal recognition. & quot;
I also really do not regard this as just personal success, no, it is the result of the good work done by all of us. & quot;
& quot; My name is just a little bit in the foreground & quot;, Lukáš Pytloun says modestly.
I wish my successors a calmer year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the aftermath of the crisis.
Thanks to its single-mindedness, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The prize for the first rank of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year was accepted by Karel Žďárský, company owner of Farmet.
The jury appreciated at the time the efforts with which he stamped out of the small tool construction in Česká Skalice a company that makes hundreds of millions of turnovers.
& quot; I can say that this award has emboldened not only myself but all of my collaborators as well. & quot; has strengthened our self-confidence in our battle with the competition. & quot;; is the last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered Karel Žďárský a small workshop for lease as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did n 't hesitate. He abandoned his career at the company where he was employed until then and founded his own company for making plastic trays together with a few of his father' s comrades.
A short time later they started to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have risen to become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it is only through the success in the mentioned contest and its medialization that it has also entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
& quot; Not only did our customers perceive the Farmet brand much more intensely now, our foreign partners also began to attach greater value to the fact of being able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country, Karel Žďárský says.
However, the past year was not only about victory euphoria for Farmet.
The appreciation was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and a part of 2009.
And 2009 in particular was the most difficult year for tool building product sales.
The crisis, which shook then even less the citizens, but mainly businesses, was just reaching its climax - many firms were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchasing of new facilities and technologies.
& quot; Of course, we could not escape this situation either. & quot;
& quot; sales fell by 40%, we had to restrict production and even resort to layoffs & quot;, Karel Žďárský explains.
A viable enterprise sometimes needs to take such unpopular action as well.
It succeeded, however, in getting to grips with the situation and keeping the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
In one, the company was unwilling to cut back - on investment in research and development.
& quot; From the grant we built a research and training centre. We encouraged our presentation at international fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions & quot;, says Žďárský.
Everything testifies that we have overcome the crisis.
Turnover is growing again, and so is the number of new employees.
& quot; I wish the new victor much pleasure in winning. But in a calmer atmosphere. & quot; is arranged by Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll clearing up on nonsensical regulations
The poll of the & quot; Absurdity of the Year & quot; is part of the entrepreneur contest for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical rules have already been removed from the world.
The dubious winner of the next year of the & quot; Absurdity of the Year poll was the obligation to create documents on authorities available online.
So decided more than one third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs.
For example, the Social Security Administration requested a paper extract from the Companies' Register, even if the civil servant could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Now, thanks to the poll, this is changing.
& quot; Czech Social Security Administration will in future no longer require extracts from the Trade Register when controlling social security payers, & quot; stated ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The whole point of the & quot; Absurdity of the Year & quot; poll is to scrutinize all the rules and regulations that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and to repeal the nonsensical ones.
This is already the fourth time this year that this is part of an entrepreneur competition hosted by the tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) and enjoys growing popularity in the public.
If approximately three thousand people took part in the vote last year, this year there have already been four thousand.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal duties, which are solely and exclusively intended to impede the company's activity.
& quot; As far as, for example, the number of income tax forms is concerned, we take a top place in the world & quot;, notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Entrepreneurship simplification has been the declared goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank data, the Czech Republic ranks 74th in terms of company terms, an eight places lower than last year's ranking.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was proclaimed for the first time in the year, and plays out each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the contest's editorial deadline at the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. Thereafter, the organizer of the contest selects seven candidates for the & quot; Antiaward & quot; and lets the public vote through the Internet on the websites www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The winner is the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, or 105 to be more precise, pointless regulations and arrangements have already been registered for this year's poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated & quot; finalists for the competition, & quot; includes, for example, provisions requiring maintenance vehicles to pay tolls for highways and expressways, or requiring contractors with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to install every two years.
The directory of this year's & quot; seven & quot; is published on the pages of the contest.
The proclamation of the contest, held each time in early November in Prague's Wenceslas Square, is part of a happening that is regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the contest's climax.
& quot; Where the state is throwing clubs between the feet of entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery. That's why my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year. Today, the & quot; is even more unnecessarily making it harder for entrepreneurs to do their business, & quot; declared Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical arrangements are having an effect.
In 2007, the people most disturbed the contractors' obligation imposed upon them to report to the Trade Office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go with an exhibition booth to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was cancelled by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office service trips of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so called the & quot; Green Card & quot;.
And - all good things come in threes:
To the absurdity of 2009 was chosen the regulation which made it compulsory for physiotherapists to have a mirror, a fridge and two personal scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Department of Health this year - the refrigerator duty fell away.
A New Category Recognizes Socially Responsible Companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's already fifth year of the Business Newspaper (HN) competition is the & quot; Company of the year 2010 & quot; category.
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair business.
& quot; We would like to support those companies that are aware of the impact your entrepreneurial activity has on the environment, and that support socially responsible initiatives & quot; says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of mobile phone company Vodafone; the caller and guarantor of this contest, as well as of the & quot; Rebel of the Year & quot;.
This year's first year of this special sub-category of the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year registered companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational, and would provide enough material for a stand-alone article.
Though they differ diametrically in terms of the object of their activity, their efforts nevertheless share a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about gehandicapte humans, because about personal problems or the health of the own employees.
Among the 14 finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera appeared. This promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years now.
Also a Poděbrady paper mill takes exemplary care of its employees with health problems, which make up 70 percent of its workforce. For this, it was honored with the title & quot; Responsible Company of the Region Middle Bohemia & quot; came in third place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition within this region.
In the Olomouc region, MiRyz Soft, an accounting firm, won. They introduced, among other things, fluent working hours, which were also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, without a proportionate reduction in pay.
The jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizen initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
& quot; We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimize the impact of our entrepreneurial activity and administration on the environment, & quot; explains its CEO Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, on the other hand, is concerned about the health of its employees. That is why it has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for all notebooks. It also promotes home work among its employees, and for company promotions it uses cartering services provided by a domestically protected workshop.
& quot; furthermore, we support the foundation & quot; Menschen in Not & quot;, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community & quot;, says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Also worth mentioning is the activity of the cleaning company & quot; Praní a čištění & quot; from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses to their employees.
& quot; We give our employees contributions to catering, to the commute to work, to raising their qualifications and for the holidays & quot;, says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
The Responsible Company of the Year category automatically had all district finalists of the Vodafone Firm of the Year contest registered. They answered the questions of the questionnaire accompanying the registration and sent it to the organizer no later than August 15.
Incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire have been excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
& quot; If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they would be excluded from the & quot; Responsible Company of the Year & quot; main competition. However, in the Vodafone Company of the Year main contest, they were not disqualified because of this. & quot;
& quot; A separate registration only to this contest is not possible as it is only a subcategory of the main contest company of the year, & quot;, explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & amp; Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests made by police during a public tender
Anti-corruption police made arrests at the Ground Fund building in Pilsen in recent days.
Local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was led away in handcuffs by detectives.
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a just taking place public competition for settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the properties offered in the competition fell to a concrete prospective buyer.
The latter is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for this.
& quot; At this time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the offence of fraudulent dealings in a public competition. & quot; cannot provide any further details in view of the ongoing investigations. & quot; cannot provide any additional details, "Antonie Zelená, chief of the Pilsen prosecutor's office, told the newspaper.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by the police again.
The way in which he was able to manipulate the public contest, this can only be speculated upon, given the sparse official information.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomír Černá Soil Fund, when asked by Právo on this matter, stated that the police had indeed made arrests in the Plzeň branch of the Soil Fund, and that this was during a public competition.
& quot; It was about a client and by no means one of our employees & quot;, she concreted.
The public competition had, according to Ms. Černá, the correct name for & quot; solicitation to bid entitlement to transferring plots according to the land law & quot; would take place in cases where multiple applicants expressed interest in the offered plot.
& quot; These individuals are offering, as part of the solicitation, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared land value. & quot;
& quot; will specify the sequence of prospective buyers according to the claims offered. Subsequently, the Land Fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid & quot;, the fund's spokeswoman explains.
Luboš G. obviously had information available as to who had registered at the request and as he was himself a legitimate person, having purchased a number of restitution claims, he offered to a Land Registry interest to withdraw from the contest.
Obviously against a fat severance payment.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. had already in the past too good contacts to the Pilsner Soil Fund.
So he also played a role in the cause of the former head of the Soil Fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing plots in replacement restitutions, for which location decisions had already been made on building projects.
At that time, Luboš G. acquired from the Land Fund, for example, plots of land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the point where the construction of the access road to the Borské pole industrial park was planned.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house right in the historical center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to go to Kleinbeibeichen with a heavy heart not to endanger the building project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs are rising by a few hundred per month
From January, households will not only have to face higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and sewer charges. For district heating and some places, rents will also increase.
Families will thus have to pull several hundred kronor more per month out of their wallets from January onwards than they have done so far.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 per cent more expensive, gas becomes up to 2 per cent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to one tenth more for water supplies and in some places also make district heating supplies more expensive.
Alone the increase in electricity costs the housing households several hundred kronor more per year.
Strong electricity prices have been downgraded by all major suppliers in the process, so the significant boost to electricity generation from renewable sources, namely photovoltaic systems, is to blame.
Gas only becomes moderately more expensive, but this is exactly when people need to heat the most and use the most.
So also here one has to expect several hundred crowns more per year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Primarily larger places plan price hikes.
For example, as of January, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kronor more per month for district heating. Families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 kronor more per year.
In turn, residents of Prague are threatened with a 9% increase in water and sewage charges, and this in case the city raises the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 per cent.
However, the price in Prague remains among the lowest when compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are to rise by 7.4%.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental residences, where from January the so-called rent regulation falls away.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2,500 flats in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent from January onwards.
If you disagree with this rent increase, the company will take you to court.
The regulated rents that you can still pay in close to 300,000 homes today are likely to increase by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once a good whisky, stolen from your father at the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen have to be treated in an emergency the most.
No exception are children who have to sleep out their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is derived from the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
& quot; beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk. & quot;
& quot; Today's trend is definitely hard alcohol & quot;, said Právo Luděk Pelikán, chief paediatrician at the MidBohemian clinic Hořovice.
& quot; whisky; if it succeeds in stealing a bottle from the house bar from the father; and if it does not, then at least fernet or vodka.
& quot; Vodka has the advantage of being able to mix it with Juice, then it does not smell so much & quot;;, the chief medical officer explains.
Faculty Hospital spokeswoman, Motol Eva Jurinová, agrees.
& quot; Most commonly, it's about Fernet or Rum. & quot;
& quot; This is today's alcohol trend, especially in primary schools. & quot;
& quot; was also about Slibowitz. You take it with you from your home, & quot;;, listed Ms. Jurinová.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are by no means an exception to the hospitalization.
In front of the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the paediatrics department of Motol Hospital, where the ambulance trucks delivered drunken pupils from near and far.
& quot; A girl had to be hospitalized four times. & quot;
& quot; began her career at the age of 12 when she was first admitted with 3.5mil of alcohol in the blood and in combination with & quot; ectase & quot;, the doctor described a particularly severe case.
& quot; She was at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice on some kind of dance party. & quot;
& quot; The interesting thing about this was that it didn 't seem strange at all to your mother that your daughter didn' t come home for 48 hours, & quot; marvels the chief medical officer.
Precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance when toasting with their own offspring is considered to be one of the main causes of children's growing alcoholism.
A real dependency in the true sense of the word is not what children are about, according to experts.
& quot; Under alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependency on alcohol and all related phenomena. This is not the case for these children. & quot;
In those who repeatedly drink alcohol, a negative familial-social background is most often characteristic of & quot;, Chief Physician Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the Motol Hospital, Mrs. Jurinová, by mid-November approximately forty drunken children had been admitted to the local Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunken children brought home after outpatient treatment by the parents or, where applicable, by the police are not registered.
Besides the cases where children drink only once a bottle of liquor in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes on which to rely 100%: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
& quot; The latter for two reasons - either out of grief over the bad testimony, or out of pleasure in the holidays. & quot;
& quot; In Walpurgisnacht, I have already experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording & quot;, Doctor Pelikán points out.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to contend with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The morning-after headache caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency can in fact be expelled in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that are missing from the organism.
& quot; You are clearly better off, because after the & quot; glorious & quot; evening experience, they wake up in a good mood without anything hurting anywhere. & quot;
& quot; you are just a bit confused about where you are & quot; admits Doctor Pelikán. At times he at least spoils the good mood for patients by enumerating to them the costs that the treatment will cost them.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens thousand Kronen.
& quot; may have used this as an educational tool once or twice when I have directly calculated to the children on the Visite what their drunkenness has cost them. It may well happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such party, & quot; added Doctor Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to regression procedures to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 for the first time in foreign hands - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defense exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are in possession of an alien army.
In foreign countries, they have only been seen at maneuvers or air shows so far.
This is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater L-159 aircraft.
These are currently preserved in the Aero Vodokhody, the intermediary of that business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
It is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically dispatched from Vodochody, according to Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
The L-159 single-seater combat aircraft, on the other hand, have been singled out from long-haul aircraft, and this without any further deposits or investment from the ministry's portfolio.
& quot; The double-seater L-159T1 was replaced in current condition and appearance, & quot;, Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the Army will not have to operate without two-seat combat aircraft since the Department of Defense signed a $200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159 planes into the two-seat version.
One new aircraft took over the Army in July, the second it wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to integrating the combat aircraft into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
& quot; The contract clearly states that EADS is a purchaser of the L-159 aircraft. It is intended to be used to train pilots of NATO countries.
& quot; It is therefore up to the taker. The way in which he realizes the thing & quot;, Pejšek stated.
The Business Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The bartering of five L-159 for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further planes for 3.5 billion Krona had still been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence did not have a tender procedure for procurement, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Department argued that this exchange will support the L-159's future export abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it uses only 24. It wanted to sell the rest.
By the way, buying the planes Casa is also likely to have a court replay.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defense at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have chosen the planes based on a whole European tender and by no means by addressing a single manufacturer.
The Army has already taken over three Casa aircraft, the last of which is scheduled to land at Kbely Airport in a fortnight's time.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published on Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be related to the levels of the male hormone testosterone.
& quot; our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer. & quot; does this especially in men up to sixty, & quot; co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, Professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family history of health issues, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues pursued more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer in the UK, but at the same time, they also followed 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the study's participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
These men had the same probability of developing prostate cancer as 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were of the same length.
However, for men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, compared to 87 percent for men up to sixty.
The ratio of length of the two mentioned fingers, which already form at prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones the child was exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone equals a longer index finger.
Previous research has suggested that it is precisely the testosterone that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that this study was fleetingly known to him, yet he did not consider the relation between finger length and cancer risk to be & quot; fully proven.
Czech in snow - D1 and D5 are locked
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic lies under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
Most of the roads and sidewalks are covered with mostly frozen snow. The winter service workers have been on the road in many places all night.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is closed for some accidents from trucks and cars, and also the D1 at Brno towards Prague & quot; stands for & quot;.
This was told Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91 a truck crashed. At kilometer 93 two trucks collided. There are casualties in this accident.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
Problems are also encountered at kilometre 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Again, two trucks collided.
Drivers should exit immediately after Brno at kilometre 190 or drive across Brno and at kilometre 182 drive up to the town of Kývalka.
That's where kilometre-long traffic jams form.
An accident happened on the D11 as well, right next to the access to Prague.
In Prague itself there is a blanket of snow several centimetres thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, motorcades form in Prosek. The Štěrboholská street is also completely blocked up.
The safest mode of transport there is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
Prague Crisis Unit meets at eight o 'clock in the morning.
There are also problems with the railway and the airfield.
Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express trains because of snow drifts.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun route.
Travellers are strongly advised to check the current situation.
Airport Ruzyně is closed since Wednesday 11 o 'clock at night until 5 o' clock in the morning.
Most roads in South Moravia are only passable with increased caution.
Three secondary roads are completely impassable around Vyškov. Snow drifts form in places near Brno. In the Blansko area, one is forced to use snow blowers on some roads situated higher up.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There, three streets are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Again, you will have to use snow blowers to clear the snow.
You cannot predict when they will become passable again until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for conservation reasons are only allowed to spread with inert litter, there is a blanket of snow up to five centimeters thick, ČTK pointed out.
In the Czech Republic, snow fell from two to ten centimetres of new snow, most in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimetres.
Up to 15 centimetres of new snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian region.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slowly ceasing to snow.
American soldiers have a new & quot; smart weapon & quot;.
For the first time, American troops have deployed a new & quot; smart & quot; weapon in Afghanistan. So far, it is known only by its code name, XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Your projectiles are guided to the finish by a laser with a precision of only a few metres.
The special projectiles of caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode at any point of their ballistic trajectory, not just on impact with the target.
This means you can use them against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in a trench.
From above, it is not usually protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily disable it.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new battle rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of & quot; smart & quot; technologies.
& quot; The soldier basically goes like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance. This way he gains an exact sight point after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only has to pull the trigger.
& quot; Let's say you measured 543 m. & quot;
& quot; When you pull the trigger, the gun recharges and fires the bullet at the distance of 543 yards plus minus one, two or three yards.
400 jobs will be moved
Fujitsu group relocates its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
In July of next year 400 employees will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
Fujitsu, a Japanese company, is relocating its Bad Homburg branch to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specialises in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 women and men will move their workplace from the existing office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park. This is a large office complex located on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, it should accommodate another 100 of the group's jobs that have so far been spread across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Furthermore, the open-plan offices in Astro Park are better suited to the way employees work.
Fujitsu was also only a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The managing director in charge Bernd Wagner said, & quot; with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure & quot;.
Excellent access to the airport is of great importance, especially for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company within the region caused joy for the winners and disappointment for the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that this had once again won a & quot; Global Player & quot;.
This is a & quot; great location & quot;.
Fujitsu passe zur Stadt; the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed early by management of the intention.
& quot; We have, of course, offered our help to the company & quot;, Korwisi said.
The friendly contacts could not, however, have changed anything about the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been the decisive factor.
Now it's about preventing a long empty space in such a prominent place.
& quot; I hope the owner and landlord of the building is being cooperative. & quot;
The House on Town Hall Square, previously used by Fujitsu, and the adjacent & quot; Small Vertical & quot; were among the most controversial construction projects in the spa city, along with the remaining buildings on Marienbader Platz, ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new cityscape was created between the station and the town hall. It attracted criticism both because of the massive development of the areas that were used as parking spaces and because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating firm Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, which was still affiliated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and resold to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in the following year.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu concierge describes itself as the world's third largest IT provider.
It provides computers and servers to companies, for example, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch office in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany. However, Fujitsu counts many more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
7000 square metres were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - its name alludes to its star-shaped layout - is home to, among others, the Central Association of the Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry.
Amazon locks down servers - Threats against Assange
Wikileaks is coming under increasing pressure.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind this, following the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is said to be residing in England.
The Wikileaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing attack in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server. They are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and corporations to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
& quot; Wikileaks displaced from Amazon server. & quot;
& quot; Free speech in the country of the Free & quot;, the disclosure activists informed via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had resorted to Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic cables, in order to cope with the high number of accesses to the documents.
Via Twitter, Wikileaks explained about the move further: & quot; Prima - our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe. & quot;
If Amazon has such a free speech problem, & quot; should stop selling & quot; books.
Amazon halted the use of its servers by Wikileaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman began investigating, CNN television station reported, citing Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the British & quot; Guardian & quot; reported.
& quot; I would have liked Amazon to take this action sooner given the prior releases of classified information by Wikileaks & quot;, the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from being used by servers in other countries as well.
& quot; Wikileaks & apos; illegal, egregious and reckless action is putting our national security at risk and putting lives & quot; at risk around the globe, the non-partisan senator said in a statement.
& quot; No responsible company - American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to distribute stolen material. & quot;
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report in the London newspaper & quot; The Independent & quot; is a 39-year-old Australian resident in the UK. The exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there had been threats.
& quot; There were even calls for Julian Assange to be murdered. & quot;
That's why Assange is right to fear for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations should be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - obviously ironically - on television that Assange should & quot; kill & quot; and Obama could & quot; use a drone.
Meanwhile, a fight has broken out between the White House and Assange.
President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it' ridiculous and absurd 'that Assange had requested Secretary of State Hillary Clinton' s resignation in case she was responsible for recently leaked espionage calls to diplomats.
& quot; I am not quite sure why we care about a guy's opinion with a web page, & quot; says Gibbs.
& quot; Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its a website. & quot;
The US government is now comprehensively testing the protection of its databases.
The deputy director of the Center for Counterterrorism Action, Russell Travers, has been appointed as the special representative, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing & quot; necessary structural reforms to & quot;. They became necessary after WikiLeaks' s disclosure of the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would provide security for dissidents and activists, should they find themselves endangered by the Wikileaks publication.
& quot; We have done everything we can to contact them & quot;., said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
& quot; We are ready to protect them if necessary. & quot;
The Ice University
At the & quot; Gelato University & quot; near Bologna, ice payers are being prepared for better seasons.
The three day basic course for future Gelatieri has the biggest influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice actually come from?
From Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The Gelatiere, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream maker, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice-maker art.
Using a spatula, the gelataio fetches the ice cream from the cooling counter, strokes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you do not have to go to Anzola dell & apos; Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know even more about Ice, you can 't get past the & quot; Gelato-University & quot; of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice Cream University has established the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines will live up to the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future Gelatieri has the largest influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also multi-day specialty chocolate ice cream courses and internships at the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some people're dreaming of a new career in the midlife crisis. Others just venture out onto the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 attendees from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant. She wants to bag something of her own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia is coming because her kids love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
Not only good taste is crucial, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano does n 't forget the icing on the national and generally southern superstructure in his training either. & quot; Italian Gelato is just the best - and then there is still a lot of romance involved. & quot;
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano tips the basic ingredients, milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer, which uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then instantly cool down to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap at the machine, and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, foundation for all milk ice creams.
Immediately the lecturer is stormed with questions: Can you make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How to give free rein to your own experimentation skills
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
Those who speak of ice cream & quot; only made from natural ingredients & quot; may have used stabilizers anyway - usually a natural product, such as guar gum from the guar bean.
Of course, you can make ice cream without a stabilizer, but it must then be sold within a day, otherwise it will collapse, and the customer bites on nothing but grains of ice.
Certain variations to the base mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit section or at the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
& quot; The suppliers will all try to turn dozens of flavored additions on you. & quot;
& quot; but you should just experiment. & quot;
Either at the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just for the ice cream made from the white base material. With eggs it becomes a yellow cream and with cocoa powder it becomes the basis for all possible chocolate temptations.
Now the students are allowed to join the ice machines.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - in terms of taste, that's not necessarily better.
Hazelnut Ice Cream does not necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is the Workgroup, which uses more fruit, uses less water, and uses slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced blend will really make a gelato's taste better, Luciano says.
Making ice cream is a calculation assignment: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
An extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano pulls out a device that he uses to determine the sugar content of the fruit varieties (growers use it to measure the oechsles in the must).
Fortunately, tables make calculating easier.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic manufacture of the base mass helps.
There is also a device where the finished ice cream mixture is simultaneously whipped creamy and chilled to zero temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small glitches do not escape.
The Brazilian Gustavo is splashing himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit mashed potatoes when the oversized stick mixer gets out of control.
& quot; In every course & quot; means Maestro Luciano, & quot; is only a matter of time before something like this happens. & quot;
Controllers in Twilight
The European Food Authority Efsa is infiltrated by the industry experimenting with genetically modified crops.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
& quot; It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented it well & quot;, said Testbiotech CEO Christoph Then in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa Genetically Modified Plant Expert Group, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
This is paid by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in the Efsa testing regulations for genetically modified plants, and thus had a clear conflict of interest, Then criticized.
The Efsa regulations are paragraphs-by-paragraph equal to Ilsi's position papers, thus bearing the handwriting of the industry, which was supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech criticizes a conflict of interest.
For example, a senior Efsa manager recently joined Swiss agricultural conglomerate Syngenta with no strings attached or transition time - and has thus switched sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), too, recently revealed personal links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby. This has made the Federal Environment Agency, as well as MEPs, wide-eyed.
The Efsa, however, cannot detect a conflict of interest.
One falls back on all reputable data, including those from the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it says in a statement.
Do not ask the experts working for Efsa not to have any contacts with the industry.
You would have to disclose these though.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from the worlds of science, industry and politics - for risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate, among others.
In the matter, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any attempt to feed animals, and that the reaction of genetically modified plants to environmental influences is not tested.
& quot; We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does on the field & quot; says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant. This does not provide reliable results.
& quot; If you don 't search for the risks, how can you find them? & quot; asks Then accusingly.
This is how Angelika Hilbeck sees it, too.
The scientist has been doing research in genetic engineering since 1994. She is currently working at the Technische Hochschule Zürich.
The industry is now trying more and more in Europe to influence or discredit critical scientists in this field, as in the USA.
There are therefore hardly any researchers left that are not intertwined with conglomerates.
For companies critical studies would usually not be published.
& quot; The industry controls the security research & quot;, claims Hilbeck.
The Track of Stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was standing in front of Stuttgarter Bahnhof station with the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is familiar: in September, the excavators had approached and had begun to break off a large chunk of the north wing.
The Stuttgarter Welt was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multibillion dollar lowering of the station.
When construction came to a halt, much of the wing was in pieces.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the chunks.
& quot; These stones are relics. & quot;
& quot; You are not allowed to disappear. & quot;
He raves about: & quot; A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy. & quot;
When he saw one, he said he smelled of cigarette smoke.
He does not yet know what he will do with the chunks.
Bricks have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trail of the Stuttgart bricks leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old trades old stones.
He bought all of those incurred during the demolition in Stuttgart.
& quot; It would be a shame they would be ground to gravel or disappear into the landfill & quot;, he says in his office, a wooden bunker that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when it appeared in the newspapers in September that he had purchased the remnants of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he was talking to the S-21 opponents, for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition after all.
And if it happens, then the most sensible thing to do is to continue using the bricks.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took away one of the cuboids weigh80 kilograms on average, unit price 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but some in the hope of being able to return it when it is rebuilt.
500 tons Rongen had bought, 25 large truckloads.
About half are still stored in the forest. The rest have long since been sold.
Gardeners, landscapers, builder of houses.
From everywhere they came and dragged away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the kick-off have long since turned into & quot; Mäuerle & quot; or into boundaries of herb beds.
& quot; Actually, this stone is nothing special & quot; says Rongen.
& quot; wouldn 't be the policy component. & quot;
He climbs into his SUV, taking a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out. Later he became interested in biology. Then he became interested in computers and finally he became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40000 tonnes of bricks.
He is carting his treasures from all over Germany.
He says he is the largest Old Stone dealer of the republic.
He brakes.
Artistically hewn sandstones lie in the snow.
& quot; You once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke & quot;, he tells.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, it is raving.
& quot; My favorite stone. & quot;
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe train station.
And on.
& quot; Beautiful travertine. & quot;
Once, the cuboids belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart's Neckarstadion.
Across the snow, stones and stories, cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from Dom Sankt Blasien, tuff from Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hand-hewn and moved with simple pulleys of bottles and oxcart, he becomes quite awesome.
& quot; It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that. & quot;
He has not become rich, and he has not become stony.
But 14 people are employed by the stone dealer today. Besides, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled down in the forest.
& quot; We are working hard, but it is satisfying & quot; says the remainder user.
Coming soon, it must go to Cologne.
There are bricks to be saved there too.
Talent Battle for High-Potentials
There is a busy rush at the buffet.
16 students huddle around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweet treats.
The Technische Universität Braunschweig (Technical University of Braunschweig) and the car maker Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are to talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen at the same time.
In the battle for the brightest minds, many companies now go into close combat and, like VW, bet on collaborations with universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the lecture theatres, before they get into the job market and are wooed by others.
And because universities do not issue summaries of their students' performance, attempts are made to spot and bind the exceptional talents in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car manufacturer is courting the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with a VW logo.
It tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs, and shows them their way into the corporation.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is in charge of the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: & quot; The students get in touch with the industry and gain experience. & quot;
& quot; VW can simultaneously get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates, and consider who would be an employee. & quot;
Such cooperations, Selle says, are not uncommon.
What is new is that the students are being booed so aggressively.
& quot; otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project & quot;, says Selle.
The battle for the newly graduated will be even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer select their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they must praise themselves, and especially courtship around highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
More than 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October, according to the Association of German Engineers VDI.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta is on the talent hunt for the audit and consulting firm KPMG.
It organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt where participants must find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students the company wants to send across the USA in the next year.
Incidentally, attendees can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Whoever is allowed to play with decides in advance in two selection rounds.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants will fly to the USA.
When hewing and stabbing for the High Potentials at the universities, the guns get bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
& quot; We want to stand out from the crowd with the race. & quot;
& quot; Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us. & quot;
For Dykta talent hunters, the bill seems to be working.
& quot; We have to date been in contact with all attendees of a similar action last year. & quot;
& quot; Some are just about to graduate and want to apply to us soon & quot; says.
Besides the direct booing on campus, especially small and medium-sized enterprises go on the stalemate also quite classically at career fairs.
& quot; We try to reach graduates at trade shows. & quot;
& quot; approximately at the Intersolar & quot;, reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company has around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the up-and-coming problem.
Currently, there are 35 vacancies on the company website.
& quot; It's very hard to fill vacancies right now. & quot;
& quot; This takes a lot of time and money & quot;, she says.
Another way is to contact via the uni-professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
& quot; The professors give hints that you can do internships with us or write your thesis. & quot;
Expensive promotions are not announced at the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
& quot; A large corporation often cannot offer & quot;, says HR Director Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in job searches for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work institute.
The institute compiles an annual list of German employers.
To do this, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their job and job environment, and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
HR Manager Stübe hopes to gain plus points from the placement with the job seekers.
& quot; I think applicants are especially looking for outside ratings about a potential employer, & quot; says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build up a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mostly internal actions.
& quot; The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees, & quot; says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal Employer Branding, i. e. employer branding within the own workforce.
& quot; Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors. & quot;
If you treat your people well and they identify themselves with the company, then they would naturally advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances.
& quot; This is like playing with gang & quot;, says Kriegler.
Obama halts new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling operations off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A similar ban was issued by the administration in Washington - thus reversing its earlier plans once and for all.
New drilling is also prohibited for the time being off the Atlantic coast.
This was announced by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to be in place for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the & quot; Deepwater Horizon & quot; drilling platform in April.
Before the accident, which killed eleven workers and resulted in the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had indicated, under pressure from the opposition and industry, that he was willing to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
Proponents thereby want to reduce the US's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Who bears the responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is still not definitively resolved today.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is faced with billions of claims.
An investigation commission commissioned by Obama is due to present its findings during the course of December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Various oil companies subsequently immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to preclude another disaster.
The Supervisory Authority responsible, which was discredited following numerous corruption allegations, is currently undergoing fundamental reform.
In parallel, Obama has announced plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the amount of oil produced in the Gulf would be considerably less than it currently is because of stricter regulation.
& quot; plans by the government are the biggest drag on the growth of the oil and gas industry & quot; is the result of a recent industry survey by the consultancy BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also bemoans the uncertainty in the industry: & quot; no one knows exactly what will change with regulation. & quot;
Investments in new support projects would be deferred until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the petrol station: billions of litres of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Ogoniland, Nigeria.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
& quot; does not plagiarize & quot;, the eco-activist calms down the journalists: & quot; you 'll still get enough oil sludge in front of the lens today. & quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading to his chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him. In the rainbow-colored water gloss, the scene looks almost pretty.
It cannot be seen that brown swaths of crude oil float under the surface.
She used to collect buckets of shrimp here, Esther Badom tells us on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing body of water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil poured from a ruptured pipeline into the huge wetlands.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fishy waters. Situated in the heart of the Niger Delta, Ogoniland is considered to be one of the most polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps traversed by streams, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat digs brown broth up, whoever dips his hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the ground like black liquorice sticks. Sadly, isolated palms can be found hanging their fronds.
Swarms of birds, which are otherwise common in wetlands, can be found in vain. As soon as the outboarder is silent, spooky silence spreads in the former paradise, which smells like a petrol station.
& quot; What is happening here is ecological warfare & quot;, Celestine Akpobari darkly says: & quot; We live in constant danger of health. & quot;
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a contested battleground for decades. It was here that the first explorers from Europe invaded more than 60 years ago. It was here that the first resistance organized itself in the 1980s, with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed. It was here that the Shell Corporation had to stop production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still barred from returning to Ogoniland. While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of Switzerland, three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland lie fallow. The situation is too unstable for the company.
Every few hundred yards, steel racks protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: & quot; Christmas trees & quot; are called the heads of the boreholes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the mark.
Such a drill head keeps breaking apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil keeps trickling into the water.
More than two billion litres, according to expert estimates, have flowed into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: the amount of oil equivalent to that which leaked into the sea off Alaska when the supertanker & quot; Exxon Valdez; quot; shipwrecked 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Who is to blame for the ongoing eco-meltdown is disputed.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting drillheads and leaking pipelines as the main culprits.
Shell applies considerably lower safety standards in Nigeria than is usual in the world, the US scholar Richard Steiner accused the corporation in 2008. The rate of defects on the lines alone is many times higher than elsewhere & quot;.
In what looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared open-air workshop, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are shatteringly naked and oil-smeared up to the neck.
There is a flicker of fire beneath one of the many barrels, which are partly connected with tubes, partly arbitrarily dispersed on the premises: an illegal small-scale refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil above the fire is heated for several hours, explains Michael, the group's boss.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collection pot, later kerosene and finally diesel trickle out at the end of the line.
So, Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel a 300 liters daily: & quot; That brings us 34,000 Naira one & quot; - around 22 dollars.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal stoves can still undercut the ridiculously low price of diesel at just under 40 euro cents per litre: because they get their raw material for free.
It's from & quot; bunkers & quot; tapping the pipeline network across Ogoniland. This is how at least 16 million gallons of crude oil are lost to the country every day across the Niger Delta, according to experts.
Only a tiny fraction of the provisionally intermediate raw material, however, is illegally refined. The lion's share is filled by organized criminal networks, which are also supposed to include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, into tanker ships and forwarded it on the world market.
The debate on whether the environmental disaster is more due to the hustle and bustle of the population or to the lax mode of production, the activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
& quot; If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders, and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refineries.
Meanwhile, the Ogoni relationship, especially with Shell, was so broken that only a deduction of the corporation could be considered. Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better. & quot;
That's when Michael gets nervous.
& quot; It's high time you & quot; disappeared, says the muscular oilman.
& quot; Every minute the soldiers can come. & quot;
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with an arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, too, who are predominantly from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to benefit from the raw material.
& quot; This damn stuff has brought our country to the dog in every way, & quot;, Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous build error in A380 engines
The A380 apparently has a major security problem.
Investigators investigating an emergency landing of a plane have discovered a possible build error, which could lead to a & quot; catastrophic engine failure & quot;.
Qantas airline is now about to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were apparently much more fortunate than previously known. The Australian Aviation Safety Board has identified a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigation - and is now warning of a possible failure to build.
The potential defect would have severe consequences: it could create fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil hose connector, according to an ATSB statement released Thursday.
This could have led to & quot; suffering a catastrophic engine failure & quot;.
Engines produced by Rolls-Royce in 20 A380 series aircraft are affected.
This includes the Qantas Airbus which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a statement of claim in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing it to pursue further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
The engine fire caused parts to come loose and damaged the wings.
Rolls-Royce identified an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be changed worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced to conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue has been deemed sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas plane made an emergency landing, the airline had kept its A380 fleet grounded for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily grounded about three of its 11 A380s.
Lufthansa exchanged engines on an A380 as a precaution.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all white: Snow has fallen almost all over the country overnight.
There is chaos on many streets, with trains and flights canceled.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany. In freezing temperatures almost the entire republic is snowed at night until Thursday. This leads to traffic chaos in many places.
To the north and to the east, there are some 15 centimetre thick snow covers.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
Winter service was in continuous operation on the A7 near Flensburg, but could not cope with the constantly blowing up snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Maritime Shipping and Hydrography (BSH) expects storm surges of 1.2 metres above normal from the morning onwards along the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein.
In Saxony, drifting snow caused significant problems on the motorways and highways.
According to the meteorological centre Meteomedia, this is why Saxon Switzerland had declared an alert level violet - the highest level ever.
At times 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell there, with fresh and strong winds producing gusts of up to 30 centimetres.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind caused congestion and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to Deutscher Bahn, significant disruption occurs in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead wires and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, the long-distance service from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were provided with woollen blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Winds of snow swept across the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds cause numerous flight cancellations.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, nearly 400 field beds are still available for them.
There were already accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed when a train collided with a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver was slightly injured.
There was a similar accident near Nuremberg due to snowy roads. Again, a truck was caught on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after flipping over her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists do have one piece of good news: while the snow will still be loose and powdery, it will therefore swirl up even in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is haunted by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - down to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could fetch up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty. The twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the finance company apparently wants to recoup the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the & quot; Financial Times Germany & quot; writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
& quot; We always check if it makes more sense to own or sell properties yourself and then rent them back, & quot;; said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution surrenders its head office already after a short period of time.
The bank had first taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of a in-house fund and then lavishly renovated them.
The energetic conversion devoured approximately 200 million euros, according to the data.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed the & quot; Greentowers & quot;, to be around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead buddy
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have paid tribute to the buried miners, who were declared dead after several explosions at a mine.
Still the corpses could not be recovered because the security situation in the accident pit is still precarious.
Less than two weeks ago there was a violent explosion at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners aged 17 to 62 years have been buried underground.
A probe had been dropped into the accident shaft, but had not detected any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescuers could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed there was no chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not yet been recovered.
Now, family members and friends commemorated the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They remained silent for two minutes.
There were 29 tables set up in honour of the buried miners, with helmets, lamps and the names of the pals on them.
Even images and personal items, including items of clothing and surfboards, found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would bring & quot; back to the surface from the depths of the Earth, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the memorial service.
& quot; But they never came home. & quot;
He could not finish with the death of his son until he had seen his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
Miners of British and South African ancestry were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Once the explosive gases have been displaced, cooling will begin to cool the blazing temperatures inside the mine, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
Go to hell, warrior!
Does Splatter Match Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores old genre boundaries with his warrior-themed epic, & quot; Valhalla Rising.
Which audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have been thinking of when he shot & quot; Walhalla Rising & quot;?
A captive Viking single-eye warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself of his tormentors and moves around his enemies in ranks using near-superhuman powers. Sounds ideal for young male viewers looking for bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and rips the bowels out of his enemies once in a while, when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, One Eye, as it is actually called, says the whole movie about no word, and even the other characters let themselves be carried away to at most one sentence or two or a few agonizing cries of death.
Otherwise you will be silenced and revelled in the creepily beautiful rolling hills of Scotland which provide the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal rather for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
Nice when a movie has multiple target audiences, shame only when they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy, & quot; Pusher; Pusher & quot;, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor, or a little less brutality, to the Arthouse.
Most art cinema fans will probably be put off by the splashing brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when One-Eye sets off for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck in the doldrums for an eternity, before the crew apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
No wonder, then, that & quot; Walhalla Rising & quot; did not find a cinema distributor in Germany. It has now only appeared on DVD.
This is a hoot, especially because of the magnificent images. But also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping façade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This movie is not about dialogues or a stringent plot, it is all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from that for the viewer.
Refn hardly allows a moment of relaxation to him. With his icy images and the sinister trance-like soundtrack he slowly closes his throat, but above all with the unbelievable hate, which beats against him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, faithfully standing by One-Eye, preserves something like innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero whose motives are never explained, but who, for enemies and temporary allies, eventually becomes the warrior from hell, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means corrupt, but maybe only for the corrupt anyway.
& quot; Walhalla Rising & quot; is a puzzling film to hate and admire, to annoyance, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Enigmatic Earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country, however, refuses to comment on this - nor does it allow checks.
At around midnight on September 5, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria, allegedly with the help of North Korea, built in the cuboid, hidden in a valley that flows away from the stream.
According to a CIA Foreign Intelligence Service briefing of late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, was well suited to producing plutonium - which could be used to build nuclear weapons.
On the other hand, the technology from the fifties is hardly suitable for other purposes.
The CIA performed a video presentation with fuzzy satellite images.
Using computer animation, it showed where which components of the reactor are said to have been before destruction, which is a scaled down copy of North Korea's model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also submitted photographs showing the building up close up, or even the interior.
The reactor was just about to start up, it was said, but had not yet been stocked with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than back then, yes, the puzzles got rather bigger with time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, while the CIA was fairly sure that Syria was building a reactor at el-Kibar before the attack, it saw little evidence that there was an active nuclear weapons program in the country, & quot;;.
Some intelligence officials in Europe prefer to be even more circumspect about this and only speak of a & quot; alleged reactor & quot;, even if they consider the CIA presentation to be & quot; plausible.
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of you, a senior UN diplomat replied in the summer only succinctly that the IAEA has & quot; enough material to ask questions & quot;.
The rubble of the alleged & quot; unused military building & quot; was hurriedly removed by the Syrians. They carefully leveled the terrain.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of man-made uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, through a member state, the IAEA obtained satellite images of commercial vendors from the period immediately after the attack, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - purchased them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected that as unlikely after analysing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as via the satellite images.
It also denies controllers a second inspection at el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel, too, remains iron silent.
& quot; We will never comment on this & quot;; recently confirmed the official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack.
For example, since June 2008, the investigation into the case has dragged on, and & quot; is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the Authority & quot;, as a senior Western diplomat admitted at IAEA headquarters in Vienna. After all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA apparently sees as the key to progress in reconnaissance three further entities that are supposed to have a functional connection with & quot; with the presumed reactor - and, unlike that, still exist.
However, the inspectors have not yet disclosed which installations are, nor what function they have, or what makes them appear suspect.
According to information from the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to by the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and located on satellite imagery a Masyaf building complex, which is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately adjacent to a military base - it is precisely on this grounds that Syria denies IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a nuclear expedition - that the IAEA was being sent by the US to spy on military installations.
For the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities following a tip-off from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photographs, that material has been moved between the three locations and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be linked to the production of & quot; fuel.
There is, however, no evidence for & quot; sensitive activities, & quot;, that is, uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes needed to build nuclear weapons, according to & quot;.
The reactor type is powered by non-enriched uranium though.
But where the uranium should have come from, and where the plutonium for the bomb should later be separated from, these key questions are at best plausible guesses.
It is also unclear whether debris that might contain valuable traces was stored at the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads have disappeared from the ground, nobody wants to know where the debris has gone.
Located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni Salt Mine, which Syria examined for its suitability as a radioactive waste dump in 1998, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
It was recently linked to the reactor by former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley in an analysis of satellite imagery for the prestigious magazine Jane & apos;'s Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria was conducting earthworks at the three suspect locations, removing large containers after the IAEA requested access.
This may be coincidence, but has done little to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles that the IAEA has spent several months on developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - the effort alone shows how big the interest of the inspectors is.
However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
Whereas Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago had placated that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter lacks a high degree of urgency, US Ambassador Glyn Davies, for instance, has been bringing forward for a few months now so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means the Viennese Atomic Authority has of enforcing controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of & quot; an option that I will be open to in the future & quot;, but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this path. For one, it needs a majority on the IAEA Board of Governors to do so. Some of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for an escalation.
On the other, as a diplomat might suggest: & quot; What if they end up finding nothing? & quot;
Love in times of war
Ever since Angelina Jolie started working on her as-yet-unnamed directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a Bosnian woman and a Serb man.
You don 't know much more about this - but that alone is enough for restlessness.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian Women Associations immediately protested, whereupon some shooting days scheduled in Sarajevo were relocated to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female Victims of War wrote to Jolie about the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), requesting a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie herself is a UN Refugee Agency Ambassador.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they refused.
Meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency., the Guardian reported.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, gave a shooting permit for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she has no political intentions with her film. She has worked very hard to familiarize herself with the Yugoslavia conflict. She wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all parties involved.
On content, though, it remains vague.
So a second synopsis about the film is circulating on the net, which then sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it even before the war broke out and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is kidnapped into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds very different indeed from the variant & quot; rape victim has a crush on torturer & quot;.
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that' s for sure.
Pressing them, Jolie says, is' unfair to & quot;, and is based on misinformation & quot;.
Now, probably only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: by illegally putting the script on the net, as so many before do.
Nothing like gone here
This evening is finally running really well again for the Irish.
No trace of grievance.
For that, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans howl with joy at crashing loud music, they stamp their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, south London, is shaking as players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance into beer cups - and hit them.
& quot; Bierpong & quot; is called the bizarre spectacle. You can win a 500 Euro winning bonus plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; that shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, don 't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old tries to amuse himself by deflecting himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
His schedule does not include gaming fun in Las Vegas. He will conduct job interviews in New Zealand in January.
& quot; I have a queasy feeling about doing & quot;, he says.
& quot; It's so far away from home and yet I have no work there. & quot;
After all: his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - & quot; she had ruck, twitching her dream job as an event manager, maybe a good sign & quot;, says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney. His brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it's on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people are likely to leave the country in the near future, experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they are even predicting 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration similar to that suffered by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery that brought great prosperity to the Irish, tristesse is now spreading once again.
The economic crisis is unsettling especially the young, well-educated Irish, for whom the only uphill climb has been so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
But now three out of ten women and men under thirty are without a job.
In the Irish Times, there are abundant letters from the readers of young emigrants, who complain: & quot; Everything is going down the drain in Ireland. & quot;
& quot; There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country will lose a whole generation with it. & quot;
& quot; The last one then please turn off the light. & quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, says she sees a bleak future ahead because the government is just 'window dressing' and does not give young people any future prospects.
& quot; you reduce the minimum wage, but you do not have a strategy for how to create new jobs & quot;, says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students shimmy from one unpaid internship to the next.
Your biggest worry, she says, is having to emigrate yourself in four years' time.
& quot; This thought is sad and depressing. & quot;
In doing so, men like Stephen McLarnon try to positively occupy the subject.
McLarnon organizes the & quot; WorkingAbroadExpo & quot;, a trade show that provides an all-round service on working abroad.
& quot; For career starters, working abroad is a great chance to take the first few steps on the career ladder, & quot; says.
On its website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O & apos; Donovan has known for half a year what it feels like to build something up elsewhere.
Because there was nothing left to do for the 29 year old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on building in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are currently pulling up a fashion store.
In January it's on to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
O 'apos; Donovan now rarely sees his home. He does extra shifts to be able to pay off the loan for his home.
& quot; The situation is already a bit crazy & quot;, he says as he steps across the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
& quot; I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never more. & quot;
He laughs a bit embarrassed and goes through cooled rooms.
The small house is situated in a fine residential area with manicured front gardens. Large, expensive cars park in the driveways.
Along with a sister, O & apos; Donovan bought the house four years ago for £380,000 - 100 per cent loan-financed.
& quot; It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions & quot; had, he says.
Is he afraid it might go wrong with the loan?
O & apos; Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says: & quot; I have no children to feed through and I am young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over. & quot;
The construction engineer does not like the wailing he hears often at the moment.
& quot; Nobody has to go hungry - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island & quot;, he says.
& quot; Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish first. & quot;
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England during the last great economic crisis.
& quot; After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply. & quot;
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and just let's see how things go with life somewhere else.
He already has a couple of years of work in London behind him and why should it not also go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
There is one thing, however, that really troubles him these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He fears it could degenerate into a farewell party.
& quot; Just not too many emotions & quot;, he says, taking a big sip of his beer.
& quot; goodbye; that sounds scary. & quot;
& quot; Let's call it a walk away party, quite casual, with a few friends, some drinks, some games. & quot;
The Democracy Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is support for private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These results were generated by the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, thus showing the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall particularly in & apo;'s eye in this year' s September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
, and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its principal institutions.
In numerous countries on the Pacific coast of South America, the democratic movement has increased greatly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by approximately 6% per year since 2002, the number of pro-democracy workers increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Such a trend can also be seen in Mexico, where the economy is recovering since last year's sharp slump.
However, only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are staunch Democrats, lowering the regional average (see chart, 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they were satisfied with their country's democratic practices. This is the same as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
Approximately 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% trust their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase over 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts at greater democracy.
That this persisted even during the Great Depression may be because the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief period of recession, and recovered rapidly.
In addition, the poor were absorbed by a stronger social safety net.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission on Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva' s popularity is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more acute and violent crime has increased.
It is only the second time since the survey began that many respondents in Latin America consider crime in their country to be a greater problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the past year. However, down from 38% in the last year, values have fallen, reaching their lowest level since 1995.
Increasing economic performance is reflected in the increased support for private and market economies. Approximately 71% of respondents nationally said private sector is indispensable to development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Approximately 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of private enterprise), though their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, is nationalizing many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
By contrast, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America consider the US to be the most influential country. This role is assumed by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A ballot box
No one expected that the November 28 elections in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of election officials who rushed to the stricken country's aid.
Cannibals crowded, votes cast multiple times, ballot papers in the gutter, polling stations destroyed, and intimidation were only a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of whom had been made homeless by the January earthquake, wandered around in search of an option.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some presumed front-runners, demanded that the election results be overturned because of an alleged fraud.
Protests erupted at times violent across the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election & quot;'s pretty good in many ways & quot;.
According to a cautious statement by observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, & quot; these irregularities, however serious, do n 't necessarily invalidate the process.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority supposedly beholden to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on December 7th.
The expected runoff is scheduled for Jan.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity action.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, is declared the winner of the runoff by the electoral commission, this could create problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake's victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Approximately 250,000 passes needed for voting were not dealt just before the election began.
The stakes are high.
Donor countries view a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Secret in Center
In the weeks following the sudden death of her husband, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a surge of sympathy that pushed her approval rating up 20 points to over 50%. That' s the highest since she was elected in 2007.
But whether this will help her win re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The characters for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who continued to steer economic policy even after his wife's election, often drew up budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenues, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential pair to spend the extra revenue as they saw fit.
On paper, Fernández's administration lost the congressional majority last year.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further rifts.
Some dissident from the ranks of the ruling Peronists lined up behind Cristina Fernández.
But, after chaotic sessions (in which one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
& quot; I am not going to discuss this & quot;;, the President said.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, giving the president even more opportunity to spend money as she sees fit.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by as much as 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation currently stands at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and union wage claims - drive the figure to close to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and the fight against poverty to be his main goals, rather than the reduction of inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector, and purged the National Institute on Statistics and Census INDEC, which then beautified the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
It has called for talks with the private sector and union leaders.
And officials say wage increases will be capped at 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But inflation eroded the growth spurt through a big devaluation in 2002.
It is perhaps for this reason that Cristina Fernández would like to financially reconnect Argentina with the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández appears to be pushing for a deal with the Paris Club backers, to whom she is owed approximately $6.7bn.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund would provide technical support for & quot; in compiling a new national consumer price index. It appears that this will be the first step towards purging INDEC.
It is not known if Fernández will continue to be politically active after she finishes her term, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it will need the support of the middle class, which is largely fed up with Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy given to them will have ebbed away.
If she wants to win another election, she must decide whether to silently override many of her husband's policy choices.
Low applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan do of its big brother across the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, set out to vote for mayors and councilmen in the five city districts. This is counted as a broad rating by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free-trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbolic figure for mainland relations. His policies have profoundly changed relations with mainland China for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only just.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater Taiwan's independence, received nearly 50% of the vote, while the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by around 8%.
For the first time the DPP moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, common occurrences occurred in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with rioters, flag-waving mass parades, and scantily-clad female dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear if the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the attack affected the election and put the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner in the campaign.
Remarkably, the mainland relationship was not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to put its relations with the Beijing government at the forefront.
But this time also the DPP avoided to stir up the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
It was responding to a new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
Ma, for his part, would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back into the Community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration as well. But the most important thing is first.
It would prefer to wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, it was severely weakened. Former Party leader Chen Shui-bian was imprisoned for corruption.
During his 2000-2008 presidency, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of centrist politicians has emerged, and the DPP is fighting for the votes of the working class and youth.
Tsai won wide support as the DPP's presidential candidate, as did Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything it can to show that it too is capable of building close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires non-prejudice discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party offers a & quot; trusted alternative to Ma's rash rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that DPP candidates would have done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even asked the pragmatist Su to abstain from the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is struggling to choose its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to submit to its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he's going to transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan has only limited support for rapprochement.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, & quot; already has no return to & quot;.
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
When you perform at a president's request people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now, surprisingly, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star on the jazz scene since her 2008 album, & quot; Esperanza & quot;, the nomination seems a little unusual. However, it complies with Grammy rules, which allow an artist to have released no more than three albums before the album he became known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, & quot; Chamber Music Society & quot;, is certainly a step forward. And with her buoyant voice and a good feel for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can easily be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose huge success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category comes closest to Spalding's nomination.
Furthermore, the album & quot; Historicity & quot; of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the Instrumental Album category. This critic's favorite experienced a huge success as a result.
Iyer's competitors include & quot; Moody 4B & quot; by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and & quot; Positootly & quot; by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough-and-ready favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest on HBO's & quot; Treme & quot;, was honored in the Contemporary Jazz category, which otherwise tends to feature albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ by wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the Large Group category. He is thus competing against the Billy Childs Emsemble with its chamber jazz and adventurous Dave Holland and its octet, whose Life-Ablum & quot; Pathways & quot; is a good example of a bass player as a Democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in Classics
The Classical nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The list is topped by Michael Daugherty's & quot; Deux Ex Machina & quot; for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey' s & quot; Dreamhouse & quot;, an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 & quot; Los Angeles & quot;. This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A. based composer Avner Dorman has also been nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from Orchestra, Opera, Choir to Solo Recordings.
In the Classical Producer category, five artists have been nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
Classical albums nominated include Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and No. 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty' s & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot; and & quot; Metropolis Symphony & quot; performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys & quot; Dreamhouse & quot; performed by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; & quot; Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati & quot; performed by
In the opera category, Bergs & quot; Lulu were won by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasses & quot; Marc Antonio e Cleopatra & quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos & quot; L & apos; Amour de Loin & quot; by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot; by the Mariinsky Theater Orchestra and Chorus; and Arthur Sullivan & quot; Ivanhoe
The composers nominated were Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot;, Hans Werner Henze for & quot; Appassionatamente Plus & quot;, Magnus Lindberg for & quot; Graffiti & quot; and Shchedrin for & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot; for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No 4th premiered and recorded at Disney Hall on January 4th by the L.A. Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece, titled & quot; Los Angeles & quot;, is dedicated to Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former oil magnate who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's & quot; Mondolinenkonzert & quot; received a nomination in the Instrumental solo with orchestra category.
The L.A. composer said he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
& quot; I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms, "Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchestral Performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson have been nominated as instrumental soloists.
Only women have been nominated as vocal soloists this year. Among them are Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the Classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of & quot; Roots - My Life, My Song & quot;.
Temecula mosque wins planning committee approval
Temecula mosque construction received unanimous approval from the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement released by the commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
& quot; The project has the support of many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others & quot;, said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Temecula Valley Islamic Center on Thursday morning.
& quot; As an American, this makes me proud. & quot;
& quot; It shows that justice reigns. & quot;
& quot; There are few opponents to & quot;, he added.
& quot; You are just very noisy. & quot;
& quot; This valley is home to some wonderful people. & quot;
The session started at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight. The votes on both sides were distributed fairly evenly, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the newspaper's website.
& quot; There is no more America & quot;, read one comment.
& quot; It's another planet of monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty lies dead in the sand. & quot;
& quot; America is at the end. & quot;
Planned Islamic Centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented along with a water filtering equipment manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 large Mediterranean-style mosque is to have two minarets and will become approximately 13m high.
It is to be built on the approximately 17,500 square feet of land on Nicolas Road near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still lodge an objection against the project with the City Council.
Arsenic-Resistant Microbe Could Enable New Life Forms on Earth or Elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that may live on, among others, arsenic, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously deemed vital.
& quot; This organism has two possibilities. & quot;
& quot; It requires either phosphorus or arsenic to grow. & quot;
& quot; This makes it very special, although it is almost a kind of & apos; alien & apos; life form, & quot;, said Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which will appear Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulfur.
However, as the scientists discovered, the bacterium in Mono Lake, California, continues to grow even when it replaces phosphor with arsenic.
& quot; It makes you wonder what else is possible & quot; said the report's co-author Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists must recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details about the discovery were released gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report might be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery of & quot; shows that in other planetary systems, organisms with the help of other elements can initiate biochemical processes, and that the & apos; standard elements of & apos;, which we believe are absolutely vital to life, are not necessarily fixed, said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
& quot; This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures, one element can be replaced by another, & quot; added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorous are chemically alike, she assumed that microbes exposed to both could possibly replace one element with the other.
& quot; The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus. & quot;
& quot; This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other. & quot;
& quot; But the difference is so big that arsenic acts differently from phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system where it smears virtually everything & quot; explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
The microbe grows better in phosphor, but that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more abundant.
According to Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorous can be replaced with arsenic is not new. But, so far, there has been no functioning example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, so science has assumed that early life forms used it.
& quot; This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from the early Earth age & quot;, said Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy, and the National Institutes of Health.
Remaining Stolen Show Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement.
The four display dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared Tuesday when unidentified persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van where the animals were housed at night outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were discovered Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff 'Department.
& quot; The good news is: the dogs are fine & quot;, according to Whitmore.
& quot; You are in good condition. & quot;
& quot; They have been returned to their rightful owners. & quot;
Whitmore did not provide specifics about the dogs' location or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
& quot; Investigation is still running. & quot;
& quot; We do n 't want to say any more about this, & quot;, Whitmore explains.
& quot; We are tracking some tracks. & quot;
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were unavailable for comment on Thursday.
They received their two dogs at a district bull shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs at separate locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were uninjured, according to authorities' statement.
But the Bunny and Peter corgis that Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce to the competition on behalf of their Japanese owners this week remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach, because Trace was supposed to participate in the contest.
As Peek told The Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions on the days preceding the AKC / Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour from Hundeschau to Hundeschau.
On Monday evening Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They often stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer pup, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them to their motel room.
The thick Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window open one slit wide, so the dogs had some fresh air to breathe.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen at 6: 00 am on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's reward to anyone who could give a hint about the corgis. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
It was not clear on Thursday if a finderwage will be paid.
Lion Roars Back After Court Approval of MGM Restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light for a fresh start.
A New York bankruptcy judge officially rubber-stamped the & quot; creditors plan on Thursday to repay $5 billion in debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to make new movies and TV shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of the US Bankruptcy Code, so nothing will stand in the way of the reboot of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat slimmed down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, in fact, Chapter 11 will not take effect until JPMorgan Chase completes a planned $500 million bond to fund the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself raises $75 million, is running the company. Financing is due to be completed by mid-December.
Studio restructuring began in May 2009 with an assignment to investment bank Moelis & amp; Co., the company management, struggling with $300 million / year in interest payments, to help resolve their financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & amp; Cooper. Efforts to resolve MGM's financial woes and pay off the studio' s more than 140 creditors lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to bid for the company at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted few bidders and none wanted to pay the $2bn demanded by creditors.
This spring, it all started anew, when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan. After months of debates and infighting, the plan was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM officially survives bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & amp; Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 per month to manage the company, will receive a & quot; success & quot; of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio brought out only one film, and created an annual schedule of seven or eight films that are scheduled to hit theaters in early 2012.
They also plan to co-produce two films based on & quot; The Little Hobbit & quot; with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who has funded approximately 18% of MGM's loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not produce a result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gizmos can tear a sizable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is equivalent to about 10 classic jump ropes, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can spare your gift budget.
Recently, in the search for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys & quot; R & quot; Us, and a BJ & apos;'s Wholesale Club.
I realized immediately that Moore's Law had gone into effect. This year, the technology players are more powerful, and at the same time cost slightly less than last year.
And while fewer new toys are appearing with their own webpages, the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a broader offering.
More and more button-cell powered toys are coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prizes are from Toys & quot; R & quot; Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children ages 3 and up) are plush characters, the size of guinea pigs, singing a note when you press their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, by pressing it several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: once you have started pressing, you will no longer be able to stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children 2 +) is the best choice.
Using Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll features interactive features such as & apos; Simon says & apos;, and thanks to its novel hinged feet with wheel blocking, it can master the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance instructor. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will surely remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now it's back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for kids 3 and up), with a whole bunch of question cards that can turn a car ride into a lesson, with a do-it-yourself-and autocorrect feature as a teacher.
If you do not wish to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for kids 3 to 8) is the cheapest and easiest-to-use solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for kids 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassette.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children aged 3 to 7) uses for the games and eBooks a system similar to iTunes, and thanks to the SD card drive family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for kids 8 and up). The five blocks are no bigger than a match box, and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together to form words before the time runs out. It is great for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more toys have some kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online pet at Club Penguin, you can purchase, for example, a Disney Club Penguin 2 & quot; Mix & apos; N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children 6-12) which contains a coin with a secret code.
By entering the Code Online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Club Penguin Store.
This can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed toy.
The newest head cell powered micro robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for kids 5 +) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It is fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he endures quite a bit.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
China police operations getting smoother
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin paced across an urban square, checking over his nervous subordinates, issuing commands with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's rugged guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and penchant for violence - to impress viewers.
& quot; Just Stand! & quot;
& quot; look straight ahead! & quot;
& quot; Shows them & quot;, he whispered to them, & quot; how pretty girls are! & quot;
Four girls, barely past the teenage years, stood taut in white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight row.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held together by blue and white striped bows.
& quot; To me, they look average from & quot;, Mr. Tang observes dismissively.
& quot; models are pretty. & quot;
Several governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green one.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with low stare: in 2009, according to reports, 50 officers circled an improperly set up snack truck and stared at the operator until after half an hour the latter packed up and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women reinforce the city police patrols. They have been specially selected based on their appearance, good figure and youthfulness.
They are intended to give the rough-hitting police a softer, feminine aspect.
But alas, even Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve on the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce the city laws with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely present a different picture.
In January 2008, officers in Hubei Province beat a bystander to death when he filmed them using his mobile phone as they put down a protest against a rubbish dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officers trained in China attacking street vendors.
& quot; Chengguan is frightening the government & quot;, lamented the national newspaper China Daily last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a & quot; really thorough & quot; clean up.
Skeptics consider the current approach to be significantly inadequate.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News posed the question of whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job ad, women aged 18 to 22 with good build and & quot; harmonious features were sought.
You should be above average in size - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment contract ends when you reach the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too strenuous for women over 25.
& quot; The most important thing is their image & quot;, stated an unnamed district official at the quasi-government website Rednet.com.
& quot; Whether the female candidates get the job depends first of all on their appearance, like height, weight, facial features, etc. & quot;
Then come temperament and & quot; inner qualities & quot;.
& quot; Female Chengguans are like flower vases & quot;, he said. He added, & quot; however, beyond that, they have other duties & quot;.
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's municipal administration, does not wish to subscribe to this description,
admitted, however, that in China, sizing specifications in job ads is not uncommon for both genders.
Same for even face features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do n 't need to apply.
& quot; We can not use lame or hunchbacked here, unfortunately. & quot;, so Mr. Zheng.
& quot; your image would not be good. & quot;
Liu Yi, who is patrolling Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn 't feel that was sexist about her appearance.
& quot; Do you think I look sexy in this uniform? & quot; asks her with an ironic look.
Your colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, & quot; We have the task of representing the image of the city. & quot;
According to them, they do not regret the short hiring, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply scurrying traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many sandwiches and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle, before they are chased away.
& quot; Mr. Wang. Please disappear here. & quot;
& quot; We have told you this so many times before! & quot; explains Miss Xu to a trader who had fled on foot, temporarily abandoning his noodle kitchen, fixed on a bicycle cart.
According to the female civil servants, the job is more monotonous than exhausting.
& quot; It's almost the same & quot; every day, explains Huang Jing, 20, who is studying Sales in Leisure.
& quot; Everything Routine. & quot;
One reason is that the female civil servants are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, as their male colleagues do.
You can only threaten offenders by reporting them to their male supervisor.
This is intended to protect them from the public hostility that officials in China are often subjected to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, rioted after rumor circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the late-night incident. 14 government vehicles were overturned or set ablaze.
Xindu has so far escaped such outbursts of violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the tranquil Baonguang Square where the female officers patrolled this morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired, contrary to regulations, on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner was screaming and screaming.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, grim-faced officials made their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol co-ordinator, stayed behind. Turning over his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their female colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
& quot; sometimes we proceed verbally. & quot;
& quot; Sometimes but also physically & quot;, Mr. Li explains soberly.
& quot; Most of the time people start arguing. & quot;
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
State Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the charges against him following his affair with a former election aide and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's attorneys announced on Wednesday.
This decision brings to an end the most serious legal case against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal that made national headlines and dampened his career, he was considered to be a possible Republican candidate for president in 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was very pleased with the verdict after the year-long investigation & quot;.
The Senate Ethics Committee, however, could still impose a disciplinary sanction.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they have been informed by the Department of Justice that the investigation into Senator Ensign has been closed and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The ruling came as a surprise to many ethics attorneys outside the Justice Department. They believe there was sufficient evidence that Ensign violated the lobbying prohibition.
Interviews, emails, and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his election aides, win lucrative contracts to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Ensign's treasurer during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over lobbying work for them after Hampton was hired.
Because Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, it was not permitted for him to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends prior to the affair, violated the so-called revolving-door lobbying ban.
According to the published evidence, & quot; appears to be a collusion and a breach of the revolving-door statutes of & quot;, according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients in the government's sights.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics attorneys said the department seemed very cautious about handling political impeachment cases after a string of defeats that were watched by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the Attorney General.
Prosecutors & quot; are obviously terrible & quot;, said Melanie Sloan, the chairwoman of the & quot; Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics association in Washington & quot; (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers that has brought various charges against Mr. Ensign to trial.
& quot; This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them, & quot; added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead defense lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the following day telling him that the department would not file any charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had been working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator had acted in accordance with the law, his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday.
Mr. Coggins declined to detail the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
& quot; I am not comfortable going into the talking details between the Ministry of Justice and myself. Only this much can be said: we believe we have made the right decision & quot;;, he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop the investigation because of a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, alleging that a $96,000 payment by Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there wasn 't enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that has long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail dated December 2008 shows that after the firm took Mr. Hampton forward as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton in which he informed him that he was knocking the Department of Internal Affairs about a matter & quot;.
Mr. Ensign was also scheduled to have lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transportation Secretary to arrange a meeting on the airline's behalf after it hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When information about the affair first became public last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and quit his position in the Senate, where he had ranked fourth in the Republican rank.
After missing many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign will no longer be the target of a police investigation, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped the Ethics Commission would quickly follow the Justice Department 'example and halt its investigation.
& quot; Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in serving the people of Nevada, & quot; said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped away in the courtroom riots.
On a per-minute basis, they sent out their reports of gruesome witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape trial and children chained to beds in a house that burst into flames.
On Thursday, the closely watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will officially end when the judge decides on the death sentence handed down by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed motions with the court setting out grounds for an appeal, which the courts will consider for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that because of the intense coverage of the trial - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - there has been a & quot; circus atmosphere & quot; and such widespread, immediate penetration of inflammatory details that the jury has been improperly influenced by public outrage.
This objection could cause the appellate courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
& quot; As I have experienced during this trial, I do believe that it is really a danger when the introduction of the new technologies into the courtroom influences the right of every individual to a fair trial & quot;;, said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes' lead defense lawyer.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeals, issued a terse denial of the motions last week, saying that the New Media & quot; would be carefully controlled & quot;, and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passion.
But that was by no means the last word on the matter.
For decades, court filings have found that covering notoriously high-profile cases casts doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly killed his wife, and said in its decision that because of the new media, there was a & quot; carnival atmosphere in the courtroom & quot;.
Some believe that the TV series and the feature film, & quot; On the Run, & quot; is based on this crime.
Some attorneys say court appeals that consider Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate courtroom communications that were unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
& quot; There is a good reason to be worried about the influence of the new media in trials that are watched by a broad public, & quot; said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate courts might be intrigued by the idea that restricting an immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter affair is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers are laying out to discuss for years, thus delaying a conviction.
Defense attorneys also contend, for example, that Mr. Hayes might already have been a pre-convicted felon when Judge Blue did not allow them to test potential jurors' reactions by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said that photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, had filled them with horror.
Defense attorneys say they are also questioning the constitutionality of the death penalty Constitution, and argue that the judge erroneously replaced a juror who was a critic of the prosecution, and that he improperly pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to vacate the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of detailed coverage of the trial draw perhaps the most interest.
In a ruling challenge filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the campaign for the governor's office and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the new media had continually rekindled the flames of emotion about the case.
& quot; Such a daily rush of media beepers, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom & quot;, the lawyers wrote. & quot; has not been seen before in New Haven, and perhaps even nationwide.
Their focus on reporting by Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that claiming that these direct news stories are more inflammatory than slower-breaking reports is an anti-tech look that impoverishes coverage of future trials.
But some attorneys said appellate courts often face the argument that social and technical changes need to be adapted by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's attorneys reinforce that claim.
In their appeal, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction on the basis of reporting, and made it clear that the new media requires new rules.
& quot; This case & quot;, they wrote, & quot; represents Sheppard vs. Maxwell of the 21st century. & quot;
Can civility connect the divider?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of true two-party cooperation, or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the parties' struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders failed to produce a breakthrough on the big issues to deal with during the so-called & quot; lame duck session & quot;, the session at the end of a government period where no decisions are made.
From what you hear, governing was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility. Rather, it was an empty episode of partisan point-scoring.
The public meeting of the president's deficit commission on Wednesday was likewise civilized, despite the political differences that persist between members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that masks the ideological divide that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - with one demanding signs of willingness to cooperate and compromise from the other, while trying to balance the boundaries of public opinion and voters' patience after another partisan war.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting itself and its evaluation by the attendees were limited to a minimum of demands or recrimination.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Regardless of whether it is about taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election has, for at least a short time, softened Washington.
& quot; No doubt, the tone has changed & quot;, said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the & quot; Ethics and Public Policy Center & quot;.
& quot; This is unavoidable after elections.
Elections reawaken partisan passions that die away again.
And that's fine. & quot;
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the & quot; lame duck session & quot;, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution. & quot;
Bush's tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and no one is advocating them.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, be it temporary or permanent.
Likewise, a compromise can be expected on the increased unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich will be believed while denying assistance to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, there is an increased optimism that during the & quot; lame duck session & quot; it is possible to agree on these issues, while at the same time ratifying the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session & quot; may not necessarily lead to lasting cooperation between the parties when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he says, a period of non-match is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
& quot; After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation, & quot; said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
& quot; I see much that is happening from now until 2012, as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012 & quot;, he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with putting up the new Republican majority in the White House, and with the tea party voters who helped their formation.
However concerned Republican leaders may be about playing too much poker, they know they must try to keep their promises to cut government spending and undo health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial responses to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and cutting government spending.
The vice chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington, and, by their own estimation, have pushed so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes inside the commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are struggling a lot to even get close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the board, because on financial issues, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston is predicting two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take the form of party clashes next year, when Republicans will challenge Obama on the state budget, taxes and the health care system, followed later by a period of major bipartisan cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, a majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, then both parties need to be careful of the public response.
Whoever is doomed to lose will have to change course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists of both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a far more consequentially far-reaching election 2012.
Viewed this way, the courtesy displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator on the issues that still divide them.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of the & quot; kleptocracy & quot;, and it passes on some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service extort large amounts of protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
You collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organised crime gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the & quot; vertical of authority & quot; - takes its share of the money moving up the ladder.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that a clean-up operation was underway in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous defamation suits against such allegations.
In September, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt, he told a Russian TV station: '& quot; It is crazy, it is dirty, it is dirty. & quot;
& gt; An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. That is what surveys have shown.
But it is unusual for individuals to be named, as happened in the Ambassador's report, and it is unheard of for this to be done by a diplomat from a foreign country.
& quot; The Moscow government's direct connection to criminality has led some to call it a & quot; disturbed & quot; and to conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government & quot;, the memo says.
& quot; Criminal elements enjoy a & quot; kryshna & quot; (a term from the world of criminals / mafia, which literally means & quot; roof & quot; or protection). It extends across the police, state security (FSB), service inspectorate (MVD), and prosecutor's office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within Moscow's criminal world.
& quot; Luzhkov is at the top. & quot;
& quot; FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level. & quot;
& quot; Finally, the common criminals and the criminal inspectors follow on the bottom level. & quot;
& quot; This is an incompetent system. In some areas criminal groups fill a gap because the city does not offer any help. & quot;
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the largest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it is said, & quot; explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), as they not only have more weapons, resources, and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law. & quot;
& quot; is for this reason that protection by criminal gangs is no longer as sought after as it was in the past. & quot;
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself will be very modest none; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don 't pay find their business closed very quickly - due to the one or other excuse.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases believed to be full of money.
& quot; must rely on the bureaucrats & quot; in its fight against corruption, said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, in a recent interview.
& quot; But it is part of this bureaucracy. & quot;
& quot; It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia. & quot;
Without a politician, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Countrywide, Indem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th in a recent survey of global perceptions of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked by & quot; as the least corrupt & quot; to & quot; is the most corrupt & quot;).
Revealing the U.S. Embassy memo, which occurred late in the evening after Moscow time, is sure to cause displeasure within the Russian government, though, since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's faults, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that it solves problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
& quot; The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is a major factor of domestic politics in this country & quot;, he said.
& quot; But to be honest, we did not expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such unethical manner, you know. & quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete-lined classroom with dirty and flaking walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembers the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
& quot; Everyone here loves Ta Mok. & quot;
& quot; He was a good leader and he took care of his people & quot;, said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Known as & quot; the butcher of & quot; because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure, and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge capitulated to the government, longtime supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells the Khmer Rouge history for the first time to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a UN-Cambodian joint tribunal sentenced a former Khmer Rouge member for the first time when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, anxiety grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Veng, complicating their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
& quot; There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything & quot;, said Chhang Youk, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that researches the regime.
& quot; For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. & quot;
& quot; It even splits families. & quot;
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded, overthrowing the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the regime's remnants and its military fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary conducted the guerrilla war from their base in the west of Cambodia's mountains and jungles, Ta Mok raised the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, leading to the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not given in, was arrested by Dangrek Mountains government forces in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006, awaiting his trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the rank-and-file soldiers remained poor, illiterate peasants.
& quot; These people have benefited very little from capitulation & quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
& quot; You are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology. & quot;
& quot; You grew up without any professional knowledge. & quot;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng, before settling down in 1998 to live a life of poor rice farming.
& quot; Life under the Khmer Rouge was good & quot;, he said.
& quot; Ta Mok gave something to eat to everyone. & quot;
& quot; But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves. & quot;
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has raised concerns here as well.
Early next year, the court will attempt to put Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, on trial.
The court's mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those chiefly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has done little to ease the anxiety in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge's reign in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told Cambodia Documentation Center commissioners that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers are believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows over the withered grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
If the court subpoenaed her, she would refuse to go, she said.
& quot; Cambodia lives in peace and stability & quot;, she said.
& quot; If there were no more chases, here would be war. & quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled from the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court indicted more suspects, though experts and historians discuss that.
& quot; Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past & quot;, he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
& quot; reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering together the broken pieces & quot;, he said.
& quot; It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that as can understand everything. & quot;
The center created the first government-approved Khmer Rouge school textbook, the 75-page & quot; history of Democratic Cambodia & quot;.
It distributed the book in June at Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Department of Education's High School History Book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often happens in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought home the book to read.
& quot; my family rejects many parts of the book and the court; quot;, he said.
& quot; you are suspicious because you are not sure how many people are convicted by the court. & quot;
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school textbook and the court are gradually gaining influence & quot;, he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge has a powerful pull here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown by bushes and filthy with plastic trash leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned on a pile of tyres here after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31 years old, a roadside mobile phone saleswoman, said she did not know much about the man who had been burned here.
& quot; but he has a strong mind and many people here go to him to pray & quot;, she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot' s final resting place where she will drop a bush of ripe bananas - hoping it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to stop accumulating weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer be collecting highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had spent years trying to convince Belarus to stop stockpiling highly enriched uranium, and appeared to have hit a hurdle last spring.
But US government officials told The Washington Post that two secret deals have been made with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about $500 pounds, according to an official who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the subject.
The accord appears to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama's & quot; 47 Nations Nuclear Security Summit & quot; in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the next summit in 2012.
& quot; I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat on the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012). & quot;
& quot; This proves to me that it works & quot; said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership on Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton called the & quot; agreement a very significant, important, & quot; step by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
& quot; How to keep highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium & quot;, Lukashenko said at the time.
& quot; This is our raw material. We will not make dirty bombs out of it. We will not sell & quot; to anyone.
& quot; We use it exclusively for research purposes. This is all & quot;.
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago when it expressed an interest in striking a deal.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly radioactive, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to officials.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going to Belarusian research using low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
& quot; This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build confidence & quot; led to the agreement that Clinton signed, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy official who is working on Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus, according to the Joint Agreement, wants to break up its camp by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens & quot; is;.
No objections from Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government did not object to the CIA's flights of Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram sent by the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents leaked by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper & quot; El País & quot; (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega demanded that the Spanish government should be informed to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain should be adequately monitored. & quot;
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe denouncing aid to human rights-violating practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The Deputy Head of Government admitted that the Council report & quot; had met with Zapatero on the sidelines, and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide on the matter.
& quot; De la Vega pointed out that Spain has no objection to intelligence flights over Spanish territory. & quot;
& quot; you just want to be informed & quot; so as not to catch & quot; unawares, & quot; reports Aguirre via cable.
Likewise, the former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government does n 't want to give & quot; much attention to this matter, although the government has few possibilities of influence, since these are in the hands of the judges. & quot;
The prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and the Defense Minister about the CIA flights.
& quot; These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information & quot;, the Ambassador said after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nonetheless, the US was more concerned about the & quot; apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors & quot; than it was about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Defense Ministry.
& quot; This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts at discreet handling between governments & quot;, laments Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007 attended by the US Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that while the Spanish judges were insanely anxious about their independence and doing what they consider appropriate, & quot; had given his staff instructions to avoid & quot; inflated rhetorical commentary to let the tension ease. & quot;
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
& quot; Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience tells us that the PP will not hesitate to capitalise on an indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated, or deliberately ignored, acts of the US that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even though these revelations could have a negative impact on the US government. & quot;; is not a party to this.
The child murderer admits she has complained on the internet about the & quot; toil of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: & quot; Terror in Galician Style & quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is in the Internet & quot; Muki & quot;.
Under this epithet, which she keeps from an early age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both hail from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña where she was born.
The messages are from the year 2008.
To understand them, you need to know their love lives, which the ABC daily reconstructs based on testimony from their family members.
Galician woman, aged 30, began a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted one year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it was announced she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was of him, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
She entered a different relationship shortly thereafter.
The chosen person was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of her messages it can be inferred that her love affair broke up and they parted ways.
In March 2008 she is alone in Menorca, writing: & quot; Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work. & quot;
& quot; When I informed him about this, he thought it was good. But now, of course, he notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day long, and not to be free, to be able to do whatever he wants. & quot;
Later she mentions a message she has just received on her mobile phone: & quot; I want you to come back this month or send me an address to which I can send you the boy. & quot;
She complains: & quot; If he does n 't like that I leave the boy with my mother, I will pick him up when I am back. & quot;
In May, she speaks of returning to her village: & quot; This week, I am going there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th, if I do n 't want to lose them. & quot;
She declares that she will take her firstborn along if all goes well.
& quot; He will be with the one he must be with. That is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother. & quot; is a dubious intention considering their bad relationship.
There is another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
& quot; on the one hand César is satisfied, on the other hand not. & quot;
& quot; on one hand, he is with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day. & quot;
She is talking about moving to Mallorca.
& quot; There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenses for the nanny. & quot;
17th: reminders and wails.
& quot; A giant kiss from César, asking me when you are coming. & quot;
& quot; Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. Do you see, if he wants, he will find me, such a crap. & quot;
30th yet one: & quot; The boy is fine. He is going to a summer course to learn Catalan. & quot;
From Víctor, her current partner, there is a: & quot; He shoots money at me. & quot;
On the Internet, in anime and manga logs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked down, and where she called herself & quot; Muki, the prison releaser for & quot;.
& quot; Terror a la gallega (heading) & quot;.
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting warden, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He cannot believe it all happened because she did not tell him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners of Course in Menorca to the Provincial Prison of Palma.
The duty defense lawyer, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of the facts, & quot; and she did not intend to harm the little one. & quot;
Prior to this, however, she had confessed to having drowned César in the bathtub and stowed his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric evaluation.
Partido Popular won 4 additional seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the November 28 results, the PP could play a decisive role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already turning its attention to the parliamentary elections - early or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party gets in these elections is usually twice as much as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of redirecting the PSC's vote share and binding PP' s electorate - continues, PP's analysts predict that in the general election, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while CiU too would gain four (it now has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 deputies (out of 25).
These calculations prove the fundamental importance of Catalonia to PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its MP or gain an extra one.
However, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the next date for the municipal elections will fall in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to put an end to socialist domination in four provincial capitals and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the city councils with the largest budget: €661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists will not be able to secure a majority, nor will they be able to rely on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the republican debacle, it is not far-fetched that this party will lose its representation on the municipal council of Barcelonas, where it would have to gain 5% of the votes.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced they can play the main role in Tarragona's turnaround. There they had governed together with the PP in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida, the PP is just 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, has a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
Also in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People's Party recorded a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 municipalities of Catalonia, and aims to create lists in as many locations as possible.
The Catalan cell obtained Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerian arrested by police from the Barcelona Police Intelligence Unit formed the Thai-controlled jihadist cell that supplied passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the & quot; Movement to Liberate Tamil Eelam & quot; (LTTE) and & quot; Lashkar e-Taiba (Let) - the latter was the author of the 2008 bombings in Bombay that killed 106 people.
The Spanish Interior Minister attaches great importance to these investigations. He goes so far as to assure that with the & quot; Operation Kampai & quot;, Al Qaeda's counterfeiting apparatus worldwide has been weakened & quot;, and thus & quot;' s ability to act.
The researchers believe that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified, and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy of Al Qaeda, so that their & quot; fighters could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The cell uncovered is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. That is why, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks on the EU's territory in the coming days, such as the one carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad, and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), another was carried out in Thailand, arresting the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt, as well as the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
You had headed the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - particularly stole passports from tourists according to the requirements of the so-called & quot; International Islamic Front & quot;.
This means that the documents had to be issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 and had to be valid for several more years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In investigation circles it is pointed out that so far no connection could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, & quot; Lashkar e-Taiba was & quot;, one of the recipients groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination attempt from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent through a money transfer company. These dollars were invested in purchasing prepaid cards for & quot; mobile phones. These were later used by members of the & quot; command, putting an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized an extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to delay the tax agreement
The PPC leader, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally submit to Artur Mas her conditions in support of his inauguration as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are no different from those made during the election campaign, and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement, which the regionalist leader wants to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas with the assurance given to her by the 18 deputies she won last Sunday - a figure more than sufficient to feel indispensable. For the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU depends on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain from voting when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to make in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently engaged in with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As far as the PPC party chairwoman is concerned, she demands that, in support of & quot;'s inauguration, all discourse relating to Catalonia's sovereignty and independence, as well as an agreement on the financial equilibrium between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country -, and which CiU' s leader even wants to subject to a referendum.
What both leaders have in common is that they want to streamline the hyped up political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the negotiations at the start of Mas.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - announcing a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home affirms that the deaths are not due to & quot; lack of action & quot;
Olot nursing home owners do not rule out the possibility that their caregiver killed eleven elderly
The leaders of the nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they highlighted the damage done to the institution by the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmé - the caretaker who, while working, had killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for.
The director of the nursing home for the elderly, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that & quot; La Caritat wants to sue the person responsible (for the deaths). & quot;, however, & quot; the law and our liability force us to accept the process and the civil liability & quot;.
The institution must not only accept a loss of social prestige because it did not determine the criminal actions of the keeper in a timely manner. It must also now pay a large amount of compensation, calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' relatives.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder since then.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home -, suspecting that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that the formalities were handled by telephone because of their age and illnesses.
The leader of La Caritat flatly denied this point, stating that & quot; absentee action may have been the reason for the incidents at the time. & quot;
The lawyer of La Caritat added that there is no evidence of negligence on the part of any person other than the accused in the litigation. & quot;
The man already baptized as the & quot; death angel & quot; confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday, stating that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and that he murdered the second old lady one and a half months later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime where he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat explained that the staff's access to the drugs is difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail the caregiver used in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the lab tests will determine whether Vila was lying and was actually choosing a less gruesome death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by administering bleach, as he confessed to having done to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17.
In La Caritat, the keeper's testimony is not believed, not even in terms of the number of murders confessed, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they are making themselves available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank (ECB) Threat
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that & quot; markets should not underestimate our responsiveness. & quot;
Euro peripheral countries' risk spreads have risen dramatically, with European banks' shares rising by more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be wrong, and that the euro has hardly gained any points, which is cause for concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, recovering as it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear for a long time yet.
One month ago today, the European Central Bank asked us to undo our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to rescind tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the plan to purchase sovereign debt to be terminated, as it was ineffective, as well as for all exceptional temporary liquidity measures to be terminated. Only one week of unlimited access should be retained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect that the current liquidity measures will extend & quot; at least until March; & quot; will maintain quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the bond buying program will continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not fulfilled, then the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday will be set back again. If there is a stubborn insistence that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, when the bank reiterated that it would not consider buying sovereign debt, and markets subsequently collapsed, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday's auction of one-year government securities in Portugal was quite weak.
The state Asset Management spent only $500 million at 5.28%, compared with $750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nonetheless, interest rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a shift in markets' perceptions, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole have been published by Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to be approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possibly another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland lost credibility completely after failing to spot the problem with the July stress tests, the figures provided under the bailout plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday. As it still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate in the run-up to the December 14 Summit of Heads of State and Government. There, political unity is needed to show that together we are playing the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, and the other countries want to play Beethoven's Ninth.
The President of the Government of Spain yesterday presented the plan of action. The plan will be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in Autonomous Regions such as the financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures. Measures that sound like Vivaldi's Four Seasons to investors' ears.
The Zapatero and Trichet double effect explains why the Spanish stock exchange has gained 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response from the government and the Bank of Spain was quick and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a authoritative auction of a three-year sovereign bond that will benefit from the trichet effect. Therefore, we are betting on strong demand that will remove any doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain, requesting an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we do n 't need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are exceedingly expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in keeping with Caesar's wife' s motto: & quot; Now it is not only being that counts, but also appearances that count. & quot;
Only courage, we can do that!
Eulen CEO challenges Vega Sicilia shareholder meeting at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the societies Owls and El Enebro, is not abating.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will contest the shareholder meeting of El Enebro, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers it to be & quot; absolutely null and void. His children will try to obtain a majority to control the company's governing bodies - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal action for a new chapter of justice in their dispute over control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company services seems unwilling to back down in his legal battle for control of El Enebro's organs.
He was ousted from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children. They appointed themselves to Board members at the January 18 shareholder meeting of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register of Companies.
The Shareholders Meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court Number 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderclap in the Álvarez family's lap.
Invoking the magistrate to arrange the meeting is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the meeting.
The final strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a & quot; desperate means of the applicants - his five children - to use legal niceties, fraudulent machinations and misuse of rights to have the January 18 meeting declared null and void, & quot;, as official spokespersons explain.
This reasoning is the basis for challenging the Assembly in hindsight, to declare it as & quot; absolutely null & quot;.
The same protagonists, who cover themselves in discreet silence, tried already unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by way of a judge.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez & apos; seven children control 100% of the capital.
On the other hand, according to the Family Protocols, the founder of the services group demands the right of use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background to the matter that the judge is to decide on in the hearing to handle the contesting claim for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The trolleys are improved with a piece of real-time software.
Ever since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula One in 2004, their history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
At the beginning nobody paid attention to the newcomer and despite his soaring career during the last few seasons everybody bet on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferraris at the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to belittle the skills of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of Renault's engine, the & quot; secret weapon & quot;, which the Multi Siemens put Red Bull into their hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes not related to car racing.
This informatics program, referred to as PLM, was used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants, and high-precision instruments.
The goal is to faithfully reproduce or simulate a product or process before actually building it, in order to avoid errors and redundant costs.
PLM facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi aircraft, and Nissan' s most famous utility vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of Industry Department at Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull & quot; can design and execute in few hours, almost in real time & quot; the changes and improvements detected on the races and at the tests.
Russwurm points out that in 1992 an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables. They could introduce at most three or four improvements in one season.
In Red Bull's team today 180 highly skilled young people are employed. With powerful computerized facilities they perform analyses and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager stated that the PLM software is capable of analysing and improving all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to the real world in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced production equipment and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set on this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in one season.
Red Bull has built up its high-tech factory for developing and producing its racing cars in a place 50 kilometers away from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially from journalists - are heavily restricted.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula One hero is without doubt the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into the service of his participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists, whose support is invaluable and whose notoriety is zero.
The plant's head of technology, Steve Nevey, points out that five years ago you could still say that the advances in the field of R & amp; E for racing cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated to be 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computerized, for they are & quot; non-predictable gladiators & quot;.
HP will open twenty of its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a twenty store network of 80 to 100 square meter retail space each that the Multi plans to open in Spain over the next two years.
The Company agrees to this initiative with the 16 multi-brand stores that already exist, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy chairperson of HP España, Helena Herrero, gave as an example the converted shop on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has worked for thirty years.
The North American group of companies aims to have 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of which are in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming signings but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairwoman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the store opening philosophy is always the same. She relies on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the industry.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive store interiors (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all stores will look the same.
Also, HP is responsible for training store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system. She pointed out that the purpose of the exclusive sales network is to optimize & quot;'s customer service and advice to small and micro businesses when purchasing and thereafter, yes, even packaging. & quot; does not have a franchising system.
The store in Barcelona has a Pioneer pilot program, which solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
An on-line service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
& quot; this way we can solve problems in ten minutes, which sometimes take up to two days. & quot;
& quot; This system is designed especially for small and micro businesses as well as private customers. The large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service & quot; declared Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal & apos; from its rivals one million customers in three years & apos;
Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but first rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nonetheless, he foresees a slump in interest margins, which the banks try to compensate for by increasing the fees and the prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million residential customers in three years - a tray yet to be built.
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the next three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guideline in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without using the public assistance provided by the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million retail customers - 700,000 if you subtract the customers the bank will lose. This is the big challenge facing this bank, because until now it has devoted more attention to its business customers than to its personal customers.
It has added 250,000 residential customers and 50,000 businesses this year.
Its market share for private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers make up more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i. e. austerity, reducing costs. It will present the challenges it faces along with the annual accounts report.
Few banks dare to set targets and publish them in these difficult times, because the financial crisis has confused all banks' plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its Optima plan of operations, established four years ago, this year. Initially, this plan was scheduled for three years, but due to market conditions, it has been extended by one year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola emphasized that 2011 would be a & quot; difficult & quot; year & quot; with great range.
The manager assumes that Spain is just getting & quot; out of the crisis slowly.
Also, it would be very difficult for & quot; to create & quot; work in two or three years. & quot; is fundamental to the survival of banks.
While assuming that the war over liabilities - which penalizes interest margins - will subside, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks will have to pay on their issues to preserve liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans to compensate for shrinking profit margins.
& quot; The topics of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans. & quot;
& quot; We did n 't turn off the tap, but the interest differential is very high & quot;, Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order on Thursday to its branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest differentials (see Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the idea of raising & quot; fees. However, & quot; is operating within a competitive framework & quot;.
Sabadell's blueprint is based on organic growth, although the group, as always, does not rule out corporate trades.
Not for nothing does he assure that in Spain, & quot; needs larger companies. & quot;
& quot; In the coming year everything will change & quot;; assures.
It stresses that the need for capital is currently increasing & quot; enormously. It does not exclude the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into the red.
He believes that the FROB can substitute for the money market when capitalised.
Having given assurances that Sabadell could survive even a temporary closure of the markets, he invalidates the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
It stresses that nothing can be circulated, but unlike what happened in June, you can obtain short-term funding through repo deals, thus intercepting the crisis.
CECA excludes a second merger wave of savings banks
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday dismissed the possibility of a wave of savings banks mergers, highlighting the rapidity with which the sector is restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks started, several savings banks insisted not to participate in the first stage. They reserved the second round for themselves.
However, the director general of the Spanish Savings Banks Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
& quot; I believe that most of the mergers are completed. The inclusion of cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, it was more about adjustments. & quot;
& quot; The major part is completed. It may be that instead of seventeen we have thirteen or fourteen, but all important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which has strongly supported all operations. & quot;
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Chief Executives and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the & quot; concentration process was done as quickly as possible and that we must be happy with the timely process, which was established in earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España, & quot; emphasized.
& quot; The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets on hand to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically unprecedented process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62% and they are now much larger, thus we have complied with the Basel Accord & quot;, he pointed out.
Olavarrieta explained that & quot; gives a number of unsolicited opinions about the slowness of the process. They reveal the seriousness and nonsensicity of & quot;, because & quot; Banco de España exhorts us to complete on time before the end of the year. & quot;
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and that & quot; may have & quot; in the world. He added that those who doubted this would do this & quot; without deeper knowledge of & quot;.
The manager noted that in the current economic cycle, & quot; does not need to worry & quot; about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks. They have gone through a & quot; very significant & quot; concentration process. The & quot; will be completed as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very well passed the stress tests, which the ECB carried out in July.
Zapatero and Germany's Red Line
Berlin has chosen to keep the euro, while at the same time laying down conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has put forward new adjustment measures, starting with tax breaks for small and micro businesses, regulating temporary work agencies, or canceling the 426 euro support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefit, and moving on to privatizing 49 percent of AENA, the administration of Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former government president Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as being responsible for evoking the current crisis.
How to understand these operations?
Let's face it, that Merkel' s position is not a fault of her publicity work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is taking on a fundamentally new perspective of shaping our future. It conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
Given the resistance in Europe, Germany is starting to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the reinstatement of the Deutsche Mark - although that sounds more like science fiction at the moment -, supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50% of the population.
The third: a reshaping of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishing those countries that exceed the benchmarks; possibly suspending some countries' payments; and extending the cost of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is unambiguous and has been looming for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits, and the German government pulled up a constitutional reform package to prevent this from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of the divergence between what Germany thought was necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The central European country set the second signal, as Merkel painfully delayed the decision to bail out Greece.
At that time this was heavily criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and published opinion were absolutely against a bailout for Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel comes out once again with a clear position. She calls for a reform of the agreements of the European Union, in order to make it possible to rescue a country, while at the same time obliging private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as being anti-European, as it fuelled the Irish crisis and everything that followed.
But her proposal, albeit a little sweetened, has been accepted. In the coming months we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which is supposed to make these measures possible from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line which it does not intend to exceed.
It tells everyone that, even if unpopular measures need to be taken now, the old way the euro works will no longer exist from this date onwards.
2013 will be the birth of a new currency area, in which offending countries will be severely punished, may be forced to default, and, in that case, the private sector will have to absorb some of the costs.
Germany is showing us that we need to embark on a tough growth path, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain in boom times, is simply not going to be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It's not just about getting the government deficit down to three per cent by the year 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass more calmly.
And that we will continue to use the possibilities offered to us until spring 2013.
It appears that Zapatero has understood this too, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big corporations last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) points out that, despite criticizing Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order at home has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like this will change anything.
Among the possibilities considered, the one that we would have to leave the euro area stuffed with few serious countries is not to be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it has warned us.
Sports and Rule Bypass
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show inventiveness, but not a willingness to evade a sanction.
The alleged exclusion instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the November 23 match against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink to be shed about whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether maybe both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is common knowledge, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction on the next league game against the Auxerre, thus entering the next game phase without any cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules that are followed in this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen around the depicted case stems from a Real Madrid football club team (which pretends nobility and honor in its anthem and on other occasions had punished its players for similar incidences) playing the main role in it, and from the dramatization by Mourinho, who has added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior, explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule-circumvention. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
On this matter, the damage caused to the sportsman should be investigated.
The sportsman defends the opponent's physical integrity. This aspect was not jeopardized by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the offending player getting an unwarranted benefit from the opposing team. Again, this did not happen.
The paradox of the Real Madrid player's action is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand as cheating or rule evasion. The evasion of the rule has not been secretly done to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gleefully accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender drew from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be pointed out that the rival was neither placed in a less favorable position nor any benefits were requested for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players then.
The advantage obviously is that the players will start the next stage of the playing phase of the Champions League without any cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, uncertain to a certain degree, since the team might also drop out at some point. Also, with this approach, players get a sanction and move on to the second card cycle, where they drop out for accumulation with one card less than in the first cycle.
This makes it not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
At the end of the day, such actions are not directed against the spirit of sportsmanship, which includes strategic decisions, in order to derive maximum benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent any sanction (this would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they rather wanted to choose when to submit to it.
You made a strategic decision without dodging or escaping any punishment.
Although the line between inventiveness and the rule environment is blurred, I do believe that this issue is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic has arisen as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the way the rules transfer was provoked.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is of an aesthetic nature rather than an ethical one.
Offer offensive to-do for Group Christmas Dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar drops an avalanche of reservations on the days of December 16 and 17 this year.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves spread. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 Euro.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are group dinners in the run-up to Christmas. These are a source of oxygen to Barcelona's restaurant and leisure business. But, as a result of the economic crisis, they are triggering a pricing offensive to also capture the customer segment, which is the big crowd: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make the bookkeeping a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has dropped all orders in the week of December 13, with the result an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two top tellers (16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To avoid having to give up on this tradition, many workers pay for it out of their own pocket.
However the economy is, it asks for lowest prices, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona Restaurants Council, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organization dares not to predict for now what the holidays will look like during this month.
& quot; people think twice about & apos; umpteen times before making a reservation. & quot;
& quot; you would like to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices, & quot;; says.
Business will go well with those who offer & quot; quality at good prices with a good service. & quot; is a very popular choice, he adds. It's a reminder that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are most in demand for $25.
In a survey of various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of 17 December causes the vendors to collapse.
The Soteras group says that demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 Euros would boom. The group has adjusted their menus with full offers between 25 and 35 Euros according to the economic situation.
For another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to advance reservations, even from early November.
& quot; We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from $19.95 to $30, & quot; explains.
AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 eateries, does not lose any of the optimism after revenues started to flourish again since the second quarter and is looking forward to a good, if only a few days-focused, outlook for the Christmas business.
Sources for the group point out that the 18th will also be an over-active day, with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu for $30 or more as a prize hit has been added to the six group menus. You get the impression that customers are willing to spend 10% more than in the previous year and want more details in return, such as cava.
Also in some companies you can see sprouts of green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are on the rise again.
From the umbrella organisation Fecasarm (with associations such as the Barcelona Pub, Restaurant and Leisure Association), vice-chairman Enric Gomà trusts to see the end of the tunnel on it. He notes that overall the reservations are quite & quot; lively & quot;, although the customers of & quot; knock out a maximum of & quot;.
The fun of celebrating did not recede, however, no matter who pays.
The Pakistani nuclear program arouses great concern in the US
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons & quot; faster than any other country.
Revelations by Wikileaks confirm Taliban-Pakistan ties.
The contents of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department, revealed by the Wikileaks Internet portal, confirm the enormous concerns of Pakistan's nuclear program Washington.
On the fringes of the clarifying and juicy details offered by the documents on the contents of the talks and the way of thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, these reveal that the two countries' cooperation on nuclear security is not strengthened. On the contrary, & quot; is declining & quot;;, and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons & quot; at a faster rate than any other country.
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored, to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - is giving Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of former National Security Council head James Jones. These include: & quot; proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, suspected scattering of nuclear material, and the vulnerability of transporting nuclear material from & quot;.
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer regarded as excessive, and a reason to exercise caution, not only by the US, but also by Russia.
& quot; Pakistan must hire strictly faithful personnel to guard the nuclear facilities. Due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit individuals working on nuclear or missile programs, said the expert, Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
What is new about the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is waning, and the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an embassy office describing communication with Pakistan as & quot; frustrating & quot; is told by one of its office staff: & quot; Often there is no transparency. We do not get replies to offers of help, or they are rejected. & quot;
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that, despite the economic catastrophe, & quot; is producing nuclear weapons faster than any other country in Pakistan. & quot;
The Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit of the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it clear to the person in charge of & quot; that & quot; Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups. & quot;
Hunting for Wikileaks boss
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism officer to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol issues a red warning to track and locate Assange.
Anything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to elucidate.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a & quot; red alert & quot; for & quot; finding and tracking & quot; from Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Also, it is not new, it is from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the recent disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the US. It has to do with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian has to face in Sweden.
Further, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that & quot; the police knew where and how to contact Mr Assange. & quot;
Already on the 20th, the International Police Authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not notified until yesterday after receiving the authority from the Swedish authorities.
This is how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange, & quot; to temporarily arrest him and extradite him. & quot;
While Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organization, many member countries consider the red warning to be a carte blanche for an arrest - to be performed by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who released a letter saying that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities via videoconference.
You also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden and was granted the appropriate authorization by the Prosecutor, who is likened to fabled Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin.
& quot; This is like a hunt, not like a legal pursuit & quot; is accused in the letter.
While the world searches for him - and his mother, from Australia, asserts her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location. At the interview, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
& quot;, if it can be proved that it was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN, thereby violating international agreements signed by the US, should resign & quot;;;.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for his resignation "ridiculous and absurd.
& quot; I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website, & quot;, he told the broadcaster CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counter-terrorism official, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
The attempt by President-elect Barack Obama's spokesman to pay less attention to Assange is at odds with the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House of Representatives National Security Committee starting in January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations to seize their funds and prosecute anyone who supports them or contributes to them. & quot; does not have the resources to do this.
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and had to retract his statement that Assange must be killed & quot;.
& quot; Obama; would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something. & quot;
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate.
& quot; whoever was to leak information to the government, he is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution is eiein too lenient sentence & quot;;, he told the channel.
Puigcercós seeks with a wink to the Carod Nearby Peace in the ERC
The Republican leader allows the party a secret ballot on his continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe to avoid for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after losing 11 deputies and half of the electoral votes.
The party leader is aware that his threat to resign those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira is not enough. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is now as weakened as their mentor itself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
This is why, with a wink, the leader of Esquerra is trying to win over the new critics. This would secure his position until the next local elections.
For starters, yesterday announced that ERC's over 200 Regional Councillors could vote in secrecy about his remaining in office.
Using ballot, not raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a penalty slip, they could do so without having to fear retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would feel unvalidated with half the votes plus one, and he added without stating percentages, a result of & quot; in the Bulgarian style & quot; would not be good either.
Those close to Carod demand more from the president than just giving his office to the party. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme body of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree on a schedule of action with the board from now until May.
For that, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on Strategic Reorientation, that the management will submit to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, the latter is supposed to promise to bring the Congress forward to the fall of 2011, which party leaders already consider to be a fact.
The party leader of the ERC believes that the & quot; polyphony of & quot; is detrimental to stability, and strives once and for all to make the organization able to do their dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the incumbent conseller Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Given Puigcercós is an ideologue, the holder of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader & quot; is propped up in exchange for various & quot; goals.
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the & quot; restructure & quot; of the board to have it represent at least 90% of the party members. That is to include new faces from Carod's environment.
The second might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the general assembly principle as a way of working.
With this he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should allow the congresses to be held with elected delegates.
Puigcercó's & apos; team, which has already fought for this at the last two congresses, is obsessed with terminating the plenary session model - an exception in the Spanish party system.
In fact, at the quivering meeting of 2008, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This appointment is pending, as infogle of the internal turmoil of recent years was not advised to approach this matter.
Now, without critical sectors in waiting, the time may have come to revisit this matter and close it forever.
23 killed in November, 290 killed in 2010
According to the MILENIO count, four fewer cases have been registered in México than in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México. According to the MILENIO México counts, this is four fewer than in the previous month.
Among those killed are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we come to a total of 390 dead, presumably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a place in Toluca.
The subject had at least three bullets caused by firearms. The clemency shot was fired to his head and feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, a person's body was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán community of the community of Naucalpan.
On Thursday the 4th, early in the morning, farm workers found a body with marks of torture and at least three fatal bullets in the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the town of Villa Guerrero.
A message believed to have been signed by the criminal organisation La Familia Michoacana was found next to the body.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was murdered with eight bullets after leaving his home to do his job as a garbage collector.
On November 7, two 30-year-old people died as a result of bullets to the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc community of the town of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man with the mercy shot in his forehead was found on a secluded path in the community of El Naranjo. A cartridge shell fired by a.caliber firearm was found beneath the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the settlement of Playa Golondrina.
Emergency services searched for the remaining body parts but did not find them.
Tepotzotlán residents notified of the discovery of a corpse they had discovered in the Peña Colorada area. Hands were tied back and the head was bandaged.
The man had a wound that stemmed from being shot in the neck by a firearm.
In the middle of the month there were reports of the murder of two men, wrapped in blankets and found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Tizapán de Zaragoza. In addition to the victims, two death threats were also found.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes, in the locality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In an adjacent settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a notice signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the Zoquiapan community of the community of Ixtapaluca. The next morning in Huixquilucan, the corpse of a man, wrapped in a yellow-blue blanket, was found. According to the message left by his killers next to him, he was probably called Mario Ríos.
In the San Francisco Acuautla community of Ixtapaluca, the lifeless body of a woman was found with firearm bullets in her neck.
Tattoos of Santa Muerte were discovered on the woman's skin, as well as necklaces with corresponding figures.
In the last half of the month, in the community of Zinacantepec, next to a vehicle was found the body of a man with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with duct tape and a notice were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Across the bodies was a message, presumably signed by a criminal organization, that read: & quot; This happens to those who do not participate. & quot;
In Ecatepec, two bodies handcuffed with signs of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín community.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first had been decapitated in the settlement of Cuchilla Ancón, wrapped in black plastic bags. A message lay next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the settlement of Juárez.
Beside him, police found a cardboard box containing a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
China's representative told COP16 that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints, and that he would maintain his offer to cut 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China considers its offer to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei asserted that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and to convert its industry.
He said that in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its targets, but would work with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China's strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and pilot program support.
Progress has been made on all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy bill last year that includes the targets for reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had worked together with those of the central and local governments to achieve the goals of saving energy, using energy effectively and reducing emissions.
Furthermore, he pointed out, some multi-year plans have already been started or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government, and those that received funding from other countries.
For example, he was referring to the Effective Use of Energy Program, which was introduced in the last five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UN), government, and private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, a government science adviser on climate change in that country, acknowledged that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly assumed.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy usage. Energy efficiency has been increased by twenty percent over the last five years, and another one is due to happen by 2020, he explained.
Legal Exclusion Espino: César Nava
The PAN national leader stated that the former Pan-Party leader has the right to address the National Ordinary Commission and to demand whatever the law allows him.
The PAN's national leader, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barriento was lawful and that the former leader of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Ordinary Commission and demand what the law granted him.
In an interview that preceded Gabino Cué Monteagudo's complaint as the state' s governor, he stated that Espino's dismissal was a decision made at the local level.
& quot; It is an independent decision of the Ordinary Commission in Sonora. & quot;
& quot; Mr. Espino has the right to go to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional in his case via the Appeals Path, so that a decision is made by a competent body & quot;, he added.
On the other hand, he said, it's not time to think about 2012, and that an alliance on the presidential candidate never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote on December 4th and 5th, when his successor will be elected.
& quot; Das (an alliance in 2012) is a subject that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose & quot;, he pointed out.
The panicked leader explained that the PAN looks back to 71 years of dialogue, so & quot; does not frighten us about internal competition; on the contrary, & quot; we enjoy it and it strengthens & quot;, he commented.
He said that the council would undoubtedly select the best chairperson (or chairperson) Acción Nacional needed for the next three years. Therefore, he would hand over the relay to the one the council would choose. & quot;
& quot; I am quite unconcerned and open about this. I would be proud to give the office of party chairman to each of the five. & quot;
He predicted that the party's upswing recorded in the last July 4th election will be reflected in the next elections, although & quot; is not the time to think about 2012. & quot;
& quot; Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his job. & quot;
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments emerging from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla, and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be watched around the country. Therefore, & quot; has many hopes and longings placed in them, and I am sure Gabino is up to scratch. & quot;
When asked about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his discourse in the framework of his four-year rule, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
& quot; If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, should they finally get out of the & quot; closet.
He believes that the holder of the federal government can use terms like the ones he uses in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because there would be no ban on the mouth in this country, and even less censorship.
Obama pushes for undocumented students' bill on Twitter
& quot; If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act bill, then call your senators and press for passage of this bill & quot;, tweeted the President of the United States in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - Act legalizing undocumented students - with a message posted on his personal blog on the social networking site Twitter.
& quot; If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act bill, then call your senators and press & quot; for passing this bill, & quot;, 'Obama tweeted.
His short message includes a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document, which invites the public to interact with their senators on an informal basis, as the bill's vote is imminent.
& quot; With your voice we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you & quot;, he points out.
The news came after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block any vote on any bill except expand Bush-era tax breaks and expand government funding.
Announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, such a blockade could affect the Dream Act bill's vote and other projects, such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Asked about the Republicans' blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a schedule can be set for the remaining projects.
& quot; I think we still have a lot of time... & quot;
& quot; All of us agree that the tax issue must be resolved before the end of the year... & quot;
& quot; I think we can make an agreement on this at any time and after that we can plan the rest's expiration, & quot; said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that & quot; would request the vote at the end of the debate, so that the Dream Act - legislation that would allow the Senate to vote on legalizing undocumented students starting next Thursday - would become law, though next week is more likely.
The Dream Act version, or the American Dream Act, would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in this country for the last five years, and are enrolled at a higher education institution or enrolled in the Army.
But the bill's supporters need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of advocates of this project are organizing an intense lobbying operation to get the law passed.
The Democrats, of whom the majority support the Dream Act, hold 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the bill.
That's why defenders of the Dream Act must get multiple Republicans on their side, in case other Democrats choose to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most-courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who took over from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported the bill, John McCain, has not yet specified his position.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Using Literature to Put Finger Into the Wound
The second round of & apos; The Pleasure of Language & apos; was a walk in which participants made a strong case for narration
& quot; The with sex in speech I understand yes, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me? & quot; asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of & apos; Los placeres de la lengua & apos;, a cycle celebrating Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the roundtable was dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The Finger in the Wound... & quot; gets us into trouble & quot;, spat the Argentinean writer sweetly towards the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this roundtable, hosted by Marisol Shultz. Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read aloud a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz subsequently marked as a great story. Luisa tells in person, and is the protagonist, who is on the lookout for what a & quot; wound is & quot;, passing from doctor to doctor, from whom she gets no answer, but hints for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: & quot; patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound. & quot;
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that the wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: & quot; the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar. & quot;
The main character of the narrative sighs with relief, and closes by telling & quot; that she only learned about the wound, that it was really open and non-existent. But she is convinced that the pleasure in the language and its traps mix together.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called & apos; praise of the invention & apos;, and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back well-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narration did a U-turn, reporting from America, the great novel, which did not lack its own chronicler from the start, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo criticizing the abundance of stories told by the conquistadores.
& quot; Cervantes, inviting us all (the writers), mocked the pretended witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true. But otherwise, the history of America would never have been told - with imagination, which even lost the sense of shame. & quot;
However, as he points out, & quot; is the maniac and the liar who can best imagine things, & quot; is where reality and lies approach each other, where you can no longer tell which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches its peak.
He actually calls this the & apos; Tradition Cervantes & apos;.
& quot; From him we have inherited to be what is narrated. & quot;
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIL' s invitation to the roundtable & apos; Finger in der Wound & apos; contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican artist dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that afflicts her country - as well as all of Latin America - as a result of the drug-trafficking struggles.
& quot; I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned, commitment to & quot;, she declared. She emphasized that literature is communication and binding, building up between the author and the readers as with a & quot; chemical reaction & quot;;.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted & quot; this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer & quot;.
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and consciousness control also amount to dogmatism, and is forgotten. & quot; is behind every confirmation there is a little No, and behind every denial there is a little Yes. & quot;
& quot; To be in possession of our thoughts and of reality, we need to be nuanced. And nuancing often means putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in premade ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powerful ones, who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he observed, inviting them to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive matches.
Furthermore, in the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the finals, two different styles given by their respective coaches face each other, and their encounter marked by opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three losses in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive matches, and so far he has held up well, so this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentinian has exalted himself with the medal to become the second champion, he is one step behind the winners and amazingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santist strategist reached the first end game as coach at the & apos; Torneo Apertura 2002 & apos;, when del Morelia had the reins in his hand. With that, he suffered a big defeat against Toluca with 4-2. Later, at the & apos; Clausura 2003 & apos;, he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the & apos; Torneo Bicentenario 2010 & apos;, where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to suffer a setback again. The game ended in a draw with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but on the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two possibilities to pocket his title, but in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does n 't want to be chased by unhappiness again and get rid of the evil magic to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
& quot; I want to be a champion. I do n 't want to break statistics, this is for a club, for my affection I give myself, and that is why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important thing & quot;, commented the helmsman when asked about the lost endings.
The last endgame is still very much in his memory. He claims to have learned a lot from it: & quot; The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we at the line are prepared, the players too, because last time we were already prepared with two penalty meters to be retired, and I think that is a lesson, until the game is not over, there is no cause for celebration. & quot; will not be able to play the final game.
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts does not bother him, because he trusts his players: & quot; You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately fate gave us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or a fierce desire to hold the title already in our hands, that left us something for this endgame, and we hope it will not come to that this time.
It is in Romanso's power to stop being only the second champion and to taste the fame that comes with the titles for the first time.
The USA changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must introduce themselves before their interview at the consulate at the visa application service offices; costs waiting times are thus shortened.
From 10 January 2011 onwards, the procedures for applying for a visa will change at the United States Embassy and at the Consulates.
Under the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves prior to their interview in the consulate at the Visa Application Services (ASC, the initial letters are in English).
ASC staff records the applicant's biometric data, which will be reviewed by the Consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, these include:
The total cost of visa processing is decreasing because it is no longer required to pay separately for scheduling, processing the visa application and the transportation service used to hand out the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for handlers and investors.
Those who only wish to extend their visa do not need to hold a conversation at the consulate. They only need to introduce themselves at the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
As the biometric data is collected at the ASC, those applicants who need a second appointment at the Consulate for the interview will be left with less time than before.
Those applying for the visa at the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo no longer need to pay the $26 service charge.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference to present a find tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for life in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) announces an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by Astrobiology Experts. This is a science that investigates the origin, development, distribution, and future of life in the Universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured that it will present & quot; with a supervisory find for the search for extraterrestrial life, prompting speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments previously thought to be uninhabitable, there may exist human-like creatures. The hypothesis has been raised that these could transform into intelligent beings - just like humans - when their living conditions improve.
Apparently, it is a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment deemed to be too toxic to all conceivable forms of life, as the lake is high in arsenic.
In some way the microbiome uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this capability into account increases the chances that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that & quot; there is actually another life form, a second life form, which is different from the one we know. & quot;
The space agency will announce the actual scope of its mission at a press conference tomorrow, Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest moon), under the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition block
Reform of the Organs Act on Congress would usher in the bipartisanship system, they complain.
The 60th legislative period had just begun, and already an opposition bloc, led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia, and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo introduced themselves as an independent. The four questioned the following: the entry into the Chamber of the & apos; bipartisanship system & apos;.
Before the inaugural session into the 60th legislative period began, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo railed against the reform of the Organic Law, saying it would exclude them.
This reform, they repeated, would introduce a & apos; two-party system of & apos;, for now it would be two people, the same number as parties, controlling the congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau headed by the panicist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their marginal political position with these reforms.
He stated that they would speak with the representatives of PAN and PRI in the next few days to change the scheme. They assumed that there was a political will there, and if they did n 't have that, they would be subjugated again by both parties, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
& quot; Until here I come (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, which do n 't even care to consider the opinion of the others. & quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were similarities with the PRD, PT and Patrón, and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be & quot; duopolist. mail;
& quot; It is not the spirit of law reform that should rule a perpetual two-party system in Congress. & quot;
& quot; for the start, this group will start with five deputies and they will speak with more colleagues so they will be more & quot;, said the Convergencia member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to the PAN and PRI, pointed out that the Congress is currently transformed into a & apos; loot & apos; for two.
& quot; Before, it was just one party. Now they split this up into two. & quot;
Patrón Montalvo requested to respect the deputies and to assign them their place at the negotiating tables.
& quot; It is not because of top-level decisions that five, which will probably be nine MEPs, may be left out. The five, currently seen as split into disparate factions, have chosen to unite to take our place at the negotiating table because because of it reform carried out and agreed by the others, we have remained outside and we do not agree with this reform. & quot;
200,000 peso more for & quot; the supplier & quot;
The Mazatlán city council pays another cheque to the company's controversial owner of electrical equipment.
Another check for a little more than 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city council.
This brings the total amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment in the second half of the year to 1 200 000 Pesos.
According to the Increased Transparency page of the Municipality, this cheque issued to an amount of 200.144.56 pesos, with the number 9258447, was issued with the purpose of & quot; clearing open invoices & quot; on 16 November last.
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already predicted that more money would go from the community to this vendor. It is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and as a result, the number of cheques still being written out in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
& quot; Nothing was bought from her. It is just the debts being paid, just like with the other suppliers & quot;, he said in an interview.
The last cheques & quot; made to & quot; in the last quarter of the year & quot; re-emerged on & quot;: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last one of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a firm is questioned by the ASE to prevent other administrations from requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste published on July 25th the audit of cheques issued by the Municipality to its suppliers, it became known that earlier, from March 2008 to July 9th 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also Jumapam deals, where she cashed checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist Places Must Infiltrate Enhance
Tourist companies regret the foreign tourist's accident due to the bad condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the Mazatlán tourist industry applied to the authorities to pay particular attention to areas that are in a bad state and have a bad view of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Dealership Association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on various occasions, it was requested to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that the tourists find into new employment opportunities or itineraries.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had been negatively affected by the tourists coming to stroll and see the clutter, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
& quot; The politicians do n 't know what it means to have to close a business one day. They do n' t worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise they would not be doing the construction slowly and haphazardly in this way. & quot;
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall drew attention to the city' s lack of prevention and maintenance efforts.
& quot; The congregation must take on its responsibilities and avoid something like this happening again. How should it do that? Well, by a preventative maintenance instead of everything retroactively mending & quot;, he explained.
& quot; We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it needs to be maintained, also we residents have a right to a clean habitat. The city council has to change its strategy to keep the city in a good condition. & quot;
& quot; There are other places that also look unmaintained and unfinished & quot;, he said, & quot; for example el escudo y el venadito of Mazatlán. & quot;
& quot; Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and its tourist attractions constantly in check, & quot; added.
& quot; These precautions have not been given enough attention. And these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: Maintenance is urgently needed. & quot;
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it is to save the touristic places of Mazatlán, because they are not used correctly and create a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places that need to be repaired together with the city. Making the city clean, neat and attractive to tourism should be a priority.
& quot; fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be tidied up and cleaned, in order to make them attractive to tourism and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP requesting results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CCE, suggested that deputies should have the great responsibility to be a role model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán corporate branch demands a dignified parliament, free of collusion between parties and government, because Sinaloa is troubled and faces major problems.
The 60th parliament was inaugurated yesterday. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia, and another from PVEM. This makes a total of 40 People's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, be committed to society and the diverse social groups that depend on responsible work in parliament, and not repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the Business Coordination Council CCE, suggested that the new deputies should have the great responsibility to provide an example for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
& quot; We hope that MEPs will really exercise their right to act freely of collusion between the parties. It is common practice for them to make arrangements to represent their own interests, turning into carnival parcels of the ruling party and the leaders of the parliamentary groups. & quot; is not allowed to do so.
He said they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
& quot; We take care that they are doing a trustworthy job, and above all that they are working for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the recent elections. & quot; is not a member of this group.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Hotel Association Tres Islas, says that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 people's representatives is to drive and work together for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is extremely complicated.
& quot; The most important thing is that it will drive economic growth, create incentives for investment, and create infrastructure, which in some way will stimulate job creation. & quot;
With regard to the tourism sector, he asked the new MEPs to assign to the Ministry of Tourism the required position in the state budget to promote.
& quot; I understood that it is the ministry with the second least resources. This is incompatible with a major economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry. & quot;
Funds must be allocated to the tourist projects. The state security must be supported. The Alcohol Act, which has not been rewritten in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King is sought
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family wish wistfully.
Parents will find it difficult to fulfil these wishes on the next Epiphany day, because the budget is no more and no less than twelve persons and one goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do n 't give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they so crave.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, because the father has no steady job.
& quot; Sometimes times are hard because my husband does n 't have a job. But we do sell tangerines and potatoes... Already in the afternoon, I go with the Gören to the street & quot; is selling, said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten year old José Alfredo wants to have a & apos; monster car & apos; for quite some time now. For his eight month old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes in the size for one year olds.
& quot; (José Alfredo) told me, & apos; would so much like this monster & apos;, but I replied. & apos; let 'em wait, boy & apos;, because it was very expensive & quot;, Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older kids who were at school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is a size 12; ten-year-old Isaías is a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is a size 8.
The 14 year old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help make the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true, you can participate in the & apos; Holy King Is Wanted & apos; campaign by donating a toy or cash in the Noroeste newspaper lobby.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, around ten house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region as part of the smashing of a production and sales network of cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where the locations are said to have predominantly been used for drug-making.
& quot; approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash, and equipment used for production have been confiscated, & quot; said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
Eleven men and three women have been arrested in total, of which two of the men considered to be the main instigators of the drug ring are from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the courthouse in Sherbrooke just hours after their arrest.
They could be charged with, among other things, producing cannabis, possessing it for sale, plotting and providing services to crime.
These house searches had taken place following a protracted investigation that lasted more than a year.
& quot; The information obtained from the public has enabled us to conduct these arrests & quot; specified M. Ruel.
Around 70 officers from the Estria Regional Investigative Unit of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
The clandestine immigration could be easily tracked
The Conservatives' draft Bill, which the government says is designed to address the problem of ships loaded with clandestine migrants, is likely to be stamped upon after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
& quot; I strongly oppose this charter. & quot;
& quot; I am holding hands with a party that has put shackles on your feet & quot;, Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff declared to the assembled deputies after the weekly caucus meeting had finished.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any person coming from a seagoing ship identified as used to transport illegal immigrants, to be detained for up to a year, violates Canada's proposed Constitution on law and liberty.
Gilles Duceppe, the leader of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill, since he opposes the wrong target group.
& quot; We are against, and it seems that all opposition parties are against, so we 'll wait and see what the government does & & quot; does;, M. Duceppe; explained.
The criticism over the immigration issue by Olivia Chow, NDP, has alienated the critics, who claim that their party is not steadfast enough against the clandestine immigrants.
& quot; The neo-Democrats agree that you should take action against the blind passengers, and that is precisely what we are trying to do by mediating another bill, the C-35, & quot;, Chow said.
We are not in favor of the conservatives' bill, therefore, because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned for at least one year, 'Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring Canadians' will.
& quot; The Canadians emphatically tell the parliamentarians that they will not tolerate this kind of clandestine immigration, these criminal operations that affect Canada and that treat the country like a foot pedals. & quot;
& quot; you expect Canada to take tough action & quot;'said Secretary Kennedy' s response.
& quot; The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its bill of law. It could have led the country to elections that the government rejected.
However, a Conservative told the QMI agency that the government would call a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself or herself to his or her constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite the announcement by Jean Charest of the possible creation of a new standing unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the creation of a public committee of inquiry into this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Still, Wednesday's announcement surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the least at the meeting of the Quebec Police Service Standing Committee on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dudley.
There was no escaping either that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as & quot; conjuring out of the hat rabbit & quot; as well as & quot; rightfully tinkering with & quot; at the end of a table.
Minister Dutil, for his part, had once again addressed those who fear that political power has too much influence on the unit in question, which will be a unit of the future.
& quot; You will see the result when we will announce it. & quot; was content to affirm.
& quot; Man is aware of this problem. & quot;
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public survey.
& quot; The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this investigative committee, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide & quot;, he explained.
& quot; The only way to form an investigative committee is to resign Jean Charest & quot;, said Yves Boisvert, assistant professor of ethics and policy systems at ENA (State College for the Training of Senior Administrative Officers).
In order to break this impasse, he proposes to the Quebec to give the audit audit a special mandate, so that it can conduct appropriate investigations into corruption and collusion.
& quot; One should be able to expand the audit control's mandate, he decided.
He also holds the view that the Quebec could give the audit department the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to force people to testify.
Forming a standing entity is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to modify the criminal code to be more attuned to this type of crime.
This request is from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Secretary of State for Public Safety, meanwhile confirmed that his colleague from the Justice Department, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned motorcycle police groups, 131 people had been arrested although the criminal code had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism as a result.
Rivers Under Strict Monitoring
Several rivers remain under tight guard due to the heavy rainfall that has poured into some regions of the province since Tuesday.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, in the Mauricie county, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated pre-emptively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
One street has collapsed into itself during this process.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy downpours of 40 to 70 millilitres of precipitation have fallen on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 more millimetres of precipitation were expected here, according to the regions, until Thursday evening.
Areas north of the river, as well as the Outaouais valley, were worst affected.
Showers of up to 100 millimetres of rain had fallen here in total.
As to these precipitations, the snow melting, which has already accumulated in certain subdivisions, is to be added, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebecer Security Service issued flood alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The flows in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of the flood monitoring here and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has caused the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a backup bridge was torn away due to the heavy rainfall.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, crossing certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the community of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Security Service remains on high alert and closely monitors the situation, according to Security Councilwoman Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebec State High Water Centre issued flood warnings for the sharp rise of several rivers, particularly of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont reprimanded to part
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback in front of the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) because of his controversial remarks about social welfare and Haitians, as well as his off-the-cuff speaking style on radio.
The CCNR takes the view that while M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements & quot; would have included inaccurate information about social welfare and unwarrantedly negative representations of Haitians, as well as such uncouth language, which is not appropriate for broadcasts broadcast during the day. & quot;
The supervisory board also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the distribution of the names of two persons who committed suicide violates the broadcasting code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made during the broadcasts aired during the 2008 and 2010 period.
The first order was filed following a complaint by the & quot; Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec & quot;.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the show were inaccurate.
The moderators should give solid rather than misleading information.
On the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had suggested that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of board members had concluded that the message conveyed was hereby that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life crises.
& quot; The majority of the supervisory board considers that the consequences in question of sending & quot; dupont le midi & quot; would have raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and appropriate manner. & quot;
Therefore, he has not been given any rebuke for his person.
The last point of contention concerned the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had given each other a media-effective argument in this regard, which had elicited a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated to the Haiti relief, as it was not known with certainty whether those in need would actually receive the money donations.
The Board considers that these comments were not abusive in nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative representation of Haitians.
& quot; I have already served my three day suspension sentence on this matter. & quot;
& quot; My file has been virgin & quot; for one and a half years, the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the supervisory board denounces the dissemination of an uncouth expression.
In all cases, the CHOI FM broadcast announcer has acted & quot; beyond its obligations & quot;.
The consequences for the broadcaster, which among other things, should have reported its decisions once during prime time, within a three-day period.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, a Montrealer of Algerian origin, has embarked on a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in & quot; Sanda & quot; (Full Contact Kung-Fu), kickboxing as well as Thai boxing, is now stepping up to the tatami and the world's boxing rings in the quest for new challenges.
& quot; I started 12 years ago in Algeria with martial arts like Kung-Fu and kickboxing, & quot; explained Zemmal, who has resided in the metropolis since 2008, to advance among the professionals.
I personally am looking for the fight everywhere, since for those who do not like the ground combat as presented by the mixed martial arts, contests are rare in North America. & quot;
Recently, the security officer working his mark as well as employed by the company UPS, had given his rivals bad news. He won two gold medals from the World Karate as well as the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Championship held between 23 and 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
& quot; I have achieved victory in the categories of Full Contact Kickboxing and Thai boxing & quot;, he declared.
& quot; Currently I am preparing for the World Cup at San Shou in China. & quot;
& quot; It was those fighters from each category who had been invited to finish in the top four at the last World Championships. & quot;
& quot; I won bronze in Toronto 2009. & quot;
& quot; 2005 I finished 8th in Vietnam. & quot;
& quot; 2007, I finished fifth in the tournament in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009, & quot; added.
& quot; It is worth mentioning that I have made progress on each contest. & quot;
& quot; With this rhythm, I 'll be first this time or next year! & quot;
& quot; San Shou & quot; or & quot; Sanda & quot; are Chinese-origin disciplines where punches and kicks are permitted as well as floor throws.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer who has emerged from this type of martial arts is Cung Le, an American of Vietnamese origin, well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain only one event in his career, he would surely call his presence at the & quot; king of Sanda & quot;, the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu, here.
& quot; This contest is the highest ranked and most respected in China, said the personable Poundskerl.
& quot; It's a bit like the equivalent of Stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand). & quot;
& quot; This was a super experience. & quot;
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
& quot; The one who defeated me was a true pro & quot;, he parsed.
& quot; There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg). & quot;
& quot; The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category. & quot;
& quot; Then the winners of each category face each other to crown a single champion, the king of kung-fu. & quot;
450 million in contracts without a tender
Hydro-Quebec has awarded $450 million in contracts to project designers by mutual consent for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert Hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium composed of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which received the most important share, that of the project management, at a sum of $295 million without a call for proposals.
This consortium, called & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;, was formed in 2004 as a corollary to Hydro-Québec's decision to give the private sector its responsibility to hand over this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the & quot; Énergie gérance & quot; consortium grabbed the lucrative contract without there being a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia constitutes a serious ethical problem, invoking the risk of competitive repression, as well as a price increase.
& quot; This is a new way of a framed game and invalidates the competition. & quot;
& quot; This means that instead of mapped out games, one is now conducting & quot; in an open form rather than a secret way, & quot; said yesterday at a press conference. Sylvain Simard, MP of the PQ.
In the early morning Simard had raised the question in front of the National Assembly. He seems to find it difficult to understand how the public interest can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded on the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a pre-arranged game.
& quot; I remain true to my line & quot;, she ranted, asserting that the PQ had handled & quot; dishonestly & quot; and that & quot; lacks toughness & quot;.
She said it was & quot; the least & quot; the PQ can do to apologize.
The consortium model is standard practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise regarding a bid on a tender for a complex project.
The project & quot; Eastmain & quot; has a high level of complexity regarding its scope of work.
The build procedure is in progress and should be in place by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any competition taking place; there had already been negotiation.
Moreover, even with relatively simple projects, the consortium's model in Quebec is no longer an exception.
As the & quot; Le Devoir & quot; newspaper noted last week, the consortium's model applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is subject to government investigation.
A brief flyover of the Quebec Business Register allows naming more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of durable duration.
This is how, for example, Dessau company works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any link, and there are several dozen of them, traces back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
Regarding the & quot; Énergie gérance & quot; consortium, Minister Normandeau has emphasized that & quot; the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labor dynamics, and that Hydro-Quebec has been paying special attention to this fact since the 1970s. & quot;
Réal Laporte, the major employer of Société d 'apos; énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has ruffled the feathers with the fact that the contract for project management was approved by consensus.
& quot; If you are doing a tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will skyrocket. & quot;
& quot; So you have two options: either you take the people who are on that Mart and tell yourself: they will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price. & quot;
& quot; The idea, however, is that it is not the price that matters, but the expertise of the people & quot;, Laporte said.
This contract granted to the & quot; Énergie gérance & quot; Consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts have been approved by either Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper & quot; Le Devoir; counted more than 100 engineering and consulting contracts granted to companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had collected 22 contracts to itself. Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14, and Dessau 10. This does not include their participation in & quot; énergie gérance & quot;.
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
You total $449 783 344, including the contract with & quot; énergie gérance & quot; for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had stated that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the & quot; Parti libéral du Québec; are well known & quot;.
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally linked to the companies it funded & quot; & quot;, before specifying that it was more their executives.
Barometers of Responsible Use - The & quot; Green & quot; Label is non-trust
Green, but outright skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the key players of sustainable growth, but equally little confidence in the labeled brands or the eco-labels that are supposed to guide his choice.
Too bad, though it bathes in a media-driven universe teeming with information in favor of more responsible consumption. The barometer of responsible consumption has a shortage of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that turns out to be a brake on its commitment, as demonstrated by the first reading held yesterday.
While promoting consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to have little credit for those trying to sell them.
Two-thirds of Quebec people admit to being as untrustworthy about companies' environmental credentials as they are about green corporate advertising, the measurement tool, devised by the University of Sherbrooke's Responsible Consumer Center, reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the trustworthiness of the products and brands that declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
On an equal footing, the politicians' discourse on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers' inhabitants.
The information regarding responsible consumption nonetheless seems important to stimulate this consumption segment, which is currently animated by approximately only one third of Quebec users.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to put into their hands.
According to another communication, already more than half of the consumers had changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they had also favored shopping at distributors in their neighborhood, favoring buying groceries grown in their region.
Green and Responsible - the Environmental Consumption Index had reached a 64 out of the maximum score of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present himself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce his traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and environmental awareness nonetheless seems to stop at one's car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebeckers reported using public transportation or favoring the ride-sharing center to demonstrate their ecological interest in 2010.
Walking as well as cycling were also endorsed by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds into stereotypes.
Sovereign bond for acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, requested by Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle, to participate financially in the acquisition of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus as well as the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to take over the cinema complex eXcentris belonging to Daniel Langlois on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, to give it back to its actual cineastic function, apparently do not get what they asked for.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a bond at a lower than initial hoped-for amount, which could create a viable solution at favorable terms, at least according to sources extracted from the state rumor mill.
An initial action plan, as well as a request for 12.8 million, had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring. The request has since been revised down by volume.
A proposal together with a plan of action has already been sent by the President of the & quot; Société de développement des entreprises culturelles & quot; (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is in charge of the eXcentris file.
Several days ago he sent her a last factual report.
However, the cabinet counterproposal was submitted to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until December 31st to respond to this request.
In any case, the premise of government donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Recall that the Quebec owner community of cinemas and movie complexes had rebelled against a direct government investment to support the takeover of eXcentris by arguing that the Minister of Culture did not have to provide financial assistance for real estate projects there that he did not also provide to other cinema halls.
Several other market participants in the segment, on the other hand, complained of substantial, economic help.
Movie Director Daniel Langlois had presented the auteur's cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulty after the self-financed construction of the cinema. This might justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele in check.
Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the head, are, in turn, heading a privately funded campaign, of which they hope to raise a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one single screen continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the prospective buyers is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the screening of the very well done film by Xavier Beauvois & quot; Des hommes et des dieux & quot;.
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not dismiss the newspaper & quot; Le Devoir; & quot; and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-adjusted proposals made to them.
Mystery of complex-shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic cables spread by WikiLeaks shed light on the secret of what the United Nations considers to the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans; but, with the same blow, they expose the latter's sense of superiority vis-à-vis Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter on the ballot does not have Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government get its 2009 budget through!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were made public yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content to nibble at.
A liaison dated 22 September 2008, i. e. the period in which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political chiefs.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador stationed in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers various ways to explain this situation.
& quot; A near-intrinsic inferiority complex to Canadians is probably much more likely to cause Canadian political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to pass the buck on to the United States in this election (as it did in 1988 with the free-trade campaign) & quot; is what he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus & quot; the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too menacing, to speak of it & quot;.
The Ambassador understands this & quot; deafening silence & quot; even less so, because the two countries have intense political and economic ties.
& quot; Logically, & quot;, he assesses, & quot; should be the ability of a candidate, of a party, and much more of a party leader, to conduct such an essential relationship. The voter has as his key factor in mind when going to the polls. & quot;
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the message sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
& quot; your trip will help ensure the government remains in place during the vote of confidence on the federal budget in early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, caused by a $30 billion to $40 billion stimulus program, & quot; describes.
Nowhere did he mention that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas in order to prevent the parliament from being overthrown by the Coalition and the thus-conditional persistence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival program.
Another message, dated January 2008 and authored by Ambassador Wilkins, notifies Washington of the increasingly negative image spread by the dramatic series broadcast from the United States via CBC.
The Ambassador is disturbed by shows such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the & quot; No-Fly-List & quot;, or even discharges for the purposes of interrogations conducted by muscle-flesh of the CIA.
Yet another communication recounts at length how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting thereafter whether Europe was willing to accept certain detainees from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with a yes, but based on an individual & quot; case-by-case & quot; decision.
Àat the end of the meeting, as described by & quot;, he has given the Secretary of State a piece of paper concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin. & quot;
& quot; The Secretary of State has agreed to re-read the file & quot;.
Finally, note that tempers are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had declared on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be killed & quot;.
He had referenced Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Worldwide Lighting Renewal Plan
In Cancun yesterday, the UN proposed a plan to renew lighting in homes, trade and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gases (CFCs), equivalent to almost one-third of the additional reduction that must be achieved to stabilise the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments from the developed countries.
Under the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem, in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of CFCs emitted due to light exposure to the Earth would be avoided if the incandescent white light bulbs, which are still a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or, better yet, light emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet of vehicles.
In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans, designed to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
From this balance, however, one would still have to deduct 5 Gt to stabilize the 2 degree Celsius rise in climate from now until 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
The compact fluorescent bulbs reduce the energy consumption by 75%. With the new LED light bulbs you reduce this energy requirement by a further twofold.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10.000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as the ones launched this week by manufacturer Philips - this company, incidentally, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb. This gives a hint of the savings possibilities of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that these completely new type of light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also function with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have pointed out that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves because they contain mercury, and that one must therefore dispose of them as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power stations, which emit much more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power stations emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report sets out in detail the profits that each country would make thanks to this international program.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year by purchasing electricity and eight million tons of CO2. This means the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations would cost Indonesia $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has called for the & quot; immediate publication of the results of Ivory Coast's presidential election immediately after its deadline.
& quot; The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Election Commission to maintain its work and announce the provisional results without further delay & quot;, a spokesman for the UN chief stressed.
& quot; asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their accountability and to abstain from any initiative until the preliminary results are announced. & quot;
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deadline set for Wednesday at midnight, three days after the election on Sunday, to pass without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the CEI president had confirmed on television that the commission would continue & quot; work to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were multiple calls from around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round of voting under the retiring Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent, Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates that the Constitutional Council will cancel & quot; fraudulent & quot; votes in the north, achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the putsch that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N & apos; Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast's presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN' s tactics of intimidating voters in the country's north had deterred the president' s supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more convinced that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is run by Paul Yao N & apos; Dré, a political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, denying any connection to the ex-rebels, has condemned the delay in announcing the election results as & quot; unacceptable, and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone as far to claim victory.
His allies say Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew he lost; and filing a complaint with the Constitutional Court after the election commission was prevented from publishing the results is illegal.
Sunday's second round of presidential elections were billed as the coronation of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that has been divided in two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned Ivory Coast's politicians that they could be held responsible in the event of any possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo won the first round of voting on October 31 with 38% of the vote compared to 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the leading candidate.
France Unemployment Rate Stable in Third Quarter
The unemployment rate in France, in the sense of the International Labour Agency (IAA) in the metropolis, is at a stable 9.3% (including the overseas departments, it is 9.7%), as shown by the provisional, seasonally-adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The figures for the second quarter amounted to 9.3% of the working-age population in the metropolis and to 9.7%, including the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in work in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job; included in this, whether they were fit for work every two weeks or not, or whether they were looking for work or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the metropolitan unemployment rate of 24.2% (+ 0.9 percentage points in three months, + 0.5 percentage points seen over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
For their part, seniors have seen a slight increase in the jobless rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points over three months and through the year), that is 482 000 of people aged over 50, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only those aged 25-49 had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
After a dispute about its calculation methods, the Federal Statistical Office Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to use this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (the overseas departments included), compared with 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, has been under investigation. He has been sent to prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public markets and suspected fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzlement of company assets, misappropriation of commons, theft, complicity in corruption, unauthorized bribery, and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
& quot; Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight. He intends to speak out on any questions the prosecution will ask him, rather than spouting phoney. & quot;
& quot; It is easy to subject him to a number of criminal charges. It is another matter to prove & quot;, his lawyer Florence Rault told the AFP (Agence France Presse) ahead of his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man to lead the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had taken care to provide the judge with a memoradum on his justification before his hearing through his lawyers.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday evening.
According to attorney Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
He would never have known about the business scope or the destination of the associated funds, Simon says.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the Public Service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also charged with embezzlement and complicity on Wednesday, but was then released again on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts, under judicial supervision.
& quot; my client could provide explanations to the facts he was accused of. & quot;
& quot; The lead prosecutor has considered not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four more people were charged and released from custody on Tuesday night, including two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the waste disposal company Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for using & quot; unauthorized influence and passive bribery.
Two civil servants from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested. One was charged with evading and misappropriating public property by a & quot; public servant, and the other was charged with & quot; complicity in embezzling public money.
Also, the partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of & quot; stealth and embezzlement of company assets & quot;.
Among the people confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public affairs affecting Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money from & quot; high levels of & quot; crime.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in awarding public contracts, here in particular in the Disposal Branch, is conducted in April 2009 following anonymous writing in the files of several open investigation proceedings.
From close investigative sources, it appears that the investigation will focus particularly on the conditions of the award of the contract, as well as the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which as well as dealing with waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain towns in the Marseille urban catchment area (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée palace exaggerates its middleman function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for & quot; espionage & quot; kept the French public on edge, alerting diplomacy and accentuating the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the watchful gazes of United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the & quot; Le Monde & quot; newspaper provide some background information on this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give these advice on how to handle their own crisis of & quot; hostage-taking & quot; in Iran (a small group of walkers).
They show how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that freeing the young Frenchwoman does not mean the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held captive in France and wanted by the US judiciary for trafficking material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they shine a bright light on the way that the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media in order to make them believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in freeing Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in that regard.
A diplomatic telegram edited on August 12, 2009, in Paris, is titled & quot; Iran: French Comments on How to Handle Hostage Takes & quot;.
François Richier, Elysée's strategic adviser, chatted with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d' apos; Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
You explained the French method to her.
The advised the Americans to do everything possible to repatriate their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
& quot; makes noise & quot;, they said, & quot; articulates loud and clear, and without cease & quot; the words & quot; basic human rights & quot;, & quot; innocence & quot;, & quot; immediate release & quot; in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
& quot; Does this even more, especially as the Iranians are asking you not to do this & quot;.
Because & quot; silence solves nothing & quot; passing the discussion attempts over in unremarkable ways, the Iranians are & quot; master at evasive maneuvers & quot;.
Mr Richier adds that detaining foreigners is a & quot; common Iranian tactic. It is: & quot; take hostage for political blackmail.
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from jail (which was supposed to take place on August 16, the day she escaped to the French Embassy) & quot; demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians & quot; (230,000 Euros bail).
And he lets it be known that the Elysée anticipates more hostage taking, a phenomenon that & quot; will aggravate.
The Iranians could arrest & quot; in the near future any other of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living & quot; in Iran, he said.
28th August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago but continues to be held in Iran.
An information has been circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is requesting to Iran for illegal trafficking in sensitive electronic material, has been released from custody following a decision by a judge in Paris.
The American Embassy, like many other observers, poses questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks Iran's illegal networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted horse-trading?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of another meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on September 4th, François assures Richier that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only completely surprised by the judge's decision, but also tried to rebel against it.
& quot; There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice & quot; (currently Michèle; Alliot-Marie), but & quot; the French Government cannot change the judicial decision & quot;, he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under & quot; strict & quot; supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser dials a telephone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian's & quot; is currently in the buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian Embassy.
While in custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not sparing its efforts to use pronouncements and & quot; escape attempts organized by the media to make & quot; believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is playing a & quot; important & quot; and & quot; influential intermediary role.
The Americans are not observing this activity without irony, noting that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009, invokes the & quot; media blitz of the & quot; French authorities.
What is so much based on & quot; thanksgiving & quot; to Mr Assad, asks the Parisian embassy.
& quot;, despite its declarations full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did & quot;.
The document then deals with the reasons that have caused the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intense communication efforts & quot; aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of openness to Syria, he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which at the time & quot; was perceived as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad.
& quot; The Syrian role building & quot; is trying to Paris & quot; Syria to see what kind of reward can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region.
The goal is also to sow & quot; discord between Syria and Iran.
The American Embassy knows this from good sources.
On August 11, François Richier had confided to her: & quot;, of course, we do n 't know if the Syrians have done whatever & quot;.
& quot; But we thanked them in spite of everything. & quot;
& quot; This should at least create some confusion among the Iranians & quot;.
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes them at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their & quot; active role in helping to secure the release of our fellow countryman & quot;.
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a bill, called & quot; the Cinderella & quot;, that will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials indicated.
A bill to require online gaming operators to deny access to these games to under-16s after midnight will be presented to Parliament in December, according to representatives from Education and Family Affairs Ministries.
& quot; Many children play these games all night long and then have trouble with learning at school and also with having a normal life during the day. & quot;
& quot; We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep,'stated Jo Rin, Ministerial Representative entrusted with this draft law by Agence France Presse, the French press agency.
The online games are accessible again from 6 o 'clock in the morning after that.
Manufacturers have a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he said.
The government would also consider asking manufacturers to scale down the time limit granted daily access to these games to those youngsters whose parents request it, the person in charge added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to do so, allowing to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most & quot; networked & quot; countries. The newspapers report regularly on various events related to intensive use of the Internet.
The country is also the undisputed champion in worldwide online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals out of 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
2018-2022 World Cup: FIFA names the host country
In a flurry over allegations of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday named the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts, a highly political election in which wrangling over influence, as well as lobbying, threatens to eclipse the technical criteria.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 edition of FIFA's royal event will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to be able to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) for itself after the premiere in the African continent in 2010, or to continue to pursue its establishment in the United States or in Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to continue until the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the hour of election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the very beginning of the revelations when it brought about the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu). They could just as easily have ruined the chances for their own country, cradle of football, which was allowed to hold the World Cup only once, namely 1966.
The BBC had once again given breeding ground to this on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that comes under fire from three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to annoy FIFA and embarrass the English officials, who had in the first place engaged in an intense lobbying with David Cameron in these last few weeks.
The PM is hoping to replicate the move made by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who organised the 2012 Olympics for London in 2005.
Would that intense effort be enough to reinvigorate England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal does n 't lack trumps with its already finished stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries' economic and financial downsides could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal, raise the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided to denounce the blunt allusions to the allegations of the English press & quot; an unfair contest in the preparation of the & quot; vote by committee members.
& quot; You throw dirt on them. You try to compromise them & quot;, 'Putin ranted.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favourites.
First world economic power, headquarters of FIFA main sponsors. The country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
However, these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that had co-organized the 2002 contests.
Another threat: FIFA's eagerly awaited 2026 World Cup bid for China, rendering Asia' s chances of hosting 2022 null and void.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled out all the stops to host futuristic stadiums, FIFA traces their expansion to new neighborhoods, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, may suffer from the weakness of television rights (accredited by European countries, because of the time shift), FIFA's delicate nerve.
Second Mandate: the Obviousness
De Gaulle had really trimmed.
Mitterand had let it be known that he was backing down.
Valéry Giscard d 'apos; Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysée invokes the next one.
The current leader will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the disclosure does not sit well with the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as well in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's supporters claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing themselves.
On November 15th, Nicolas Sarkozy assured in a serious tone that he would make his decision to use & quot; sometime in the fall of 2011, & quot;.
That on Tuesday evening in the Elysée, in front of the UMP parliamentarians, he would sound the prospect of & quot; two seats, & quot; had spread a little feverish.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Wide.
The President simply issued a reminder that the 2008 constitutional amendment limits the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
& quot; you have at worst another seven and a half years with me, or at best & quot;, he told them in July 2009.
On a new one in May 2010: & quot; Does n 't think I am not thinking about the phase after this. & quot;
His words of the day before yesterday make him no more the candidate than the day before; but no less.
If they should elicit comments, then for a dual reason.
The acceleration of the candidacy race with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of the contest with Ségolène Royal, which pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012 that many PS members are admonishing earlier than assumed to a combat announcement.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L & apos; Express poll).
& quot; We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about this & quot;, reacted immediately and cautiously the environment of the prime minister.
& quot; If he would find defeat possible, he would not be a candidate & quot;, informs Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
& quot; He will always believe he can win. & quot; corrects Alain Juppé. He has resigned himself to the obvious.
Euro: ECB forced to keep its purchases of sovereign securities
Last year's meeting of the ECB' s Governing Council should provide an opportunity to show ways out of the crisis, or at least announce the ordering of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of european sovereign debt obliges. The central bank in Frankfurt can no doubt not afford to forfeit also today's, more than strained, situation in the european bond markets, in order not to cause their worsening.
The political cost of doing so would be far too high.
At a press conference yesterday, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving Europe' s sovereign debt.
It has not dared to say whether it thinks the central bank can do any more, for example by boosting its sovereign bond buying program.
& quot;. I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) & quot;.
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, on the eve of his hearing in Brussels by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament had not been very eloquent regarding his intentions. Rather, he was content to point out that the program of purchases of sovereign securities would continue in the secondary market & quot; and that at the meeting on Thursday we shall see & quot; as the decisions are & quot;.
Only certainty: the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, Treasury bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to approximately €1.35 billion.
And, according to indiscretions by some traders, yesterday it is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government bonds.
In total, the Eurosystem central banks have made purchases amounting to EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of a subsequent pursuit of the purchase price is in no way in doubt (see page 29).
Economists are already not expecting a notable change in the course any more.
If the bond trades of more than three months will have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be able to freely acquire the unlimited reserves of funds, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already bracing themselves for a few more months ahead of this measure.
& quot;. I cannot imagine that the ECB will modify its program in any significant way. & quot;
& quot; otherwise it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term, so surmises Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
& quot; A progressive exit envisaged for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me & quot; anticipates its turn Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign-debt market, & quot; should maintain such a volume of bond buying. This will stimulate the sluggish market & quot; will, Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the relevance of the European banks' exposed position in the sovereign debt markets in the eurozone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
& quot; must at any price go to the stellers of the deficient investors in the market and act in such a way to prevent the rash enthusiasm about the returns paid to the weakest states & quot;, testified a major bondholder yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to soar, governments would be even more prevented from reducing, or even from stabilising, their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
Berlusconi's government takes cover in Italy
After an alarming start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a bit yesterday with the fall of the corner interest rate to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the presidents of the regions, Giulio Tremonti, had described the situation as & quot; indecipherable & quot;, and heard him calculate a & quot; unpredictable & quot; weekend. However, the person in question immediately denied this.
On Tuesday anyway, the shear would have reached its record of 210 basis points with the German interest rates, and the prices of contracts covering the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out in his Council of Ministers that the gap between Spain and the German interest rates is 400 basis points.
His right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had, however, expressed himself as a & quot; seriously concerned & quot; by the & quot; market turmoil & quot; and a possible contagion from the Irish direction.
& quot; The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland. & quot;
& quot; The bad news is that, like Portugal, Italy is & quot;, says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain English, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, dwindling tax revenues, which put the state at risk of not being able to meet its funding needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the Government.
Going forward, Italian growth is expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for consideration by the Senate is expected to be 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, next year's budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP (against the 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the uproar over a new Budget Collective, which could be used to a sum of EUR 7 billion after the holidays.
& quot; If necessary, new austerity measures must be implemented & quot; says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
& quot; The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated. We have been repeating the & quot; for a long time now, assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
& quot; At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term, or in the long term, because, despite its high debt level (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.), Italy is asked to make less progress towards stabilisation than other countries & quot;, observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the OECD.
Remains the question of political unsteadiness.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a no-confidence motion from the Chamber of Deputies, which could result in the early elections being organised as early as the end of March.
So there is an unfavourable period ahead for resolving a major crisis.
Europeans ponder expanding the anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde made it explicit yesterday at a press conference in Paris: & quot; I think it was proved again on Sunday afternoon and in the evening: the Europeans clearly stick together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency territory.
Although perfectly relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of the european sovereign bonds was water on the windmills of the governments as well as the ECB.
However, there is no sign of a start of normalization yet.
The rating agency Standard & amp; Poor & apos;'s had announced that it could downgrade Portugal' s debt rating, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
& quot; As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and policy visibility, weighing down & quot;'s banking systems particularly, according to economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since the political time passes much more slowly than that of the & quot; markets.
The European countries, well aware of both this gap and the danger it conceals, are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening the anti-crisis measures already in place.
Informal discussions are progressing well between the finance ministers most directly affected and, more broadly, with their counterparts of the G20.
And this also in view of the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the horizon is the lot of the unconventional back-strengthening measures of the countries of the Eurozone in the cross hairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Funds are concerned, their Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asian tour on Tuesday in Singapore, in order to inform investors in the Far East about developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If his visit does not involve explicit fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for it to do so.
The first advertising paper editions by the EU Stability Fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative had confided to the Reuters agency that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the IMF's additional direct involvement.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the front-row countries, are gearing up to adopt structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that add to the austerity measures, but are intended to have an effect in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path to what Greece and Ireland have done.
At all costs, both the one and the other is to avoid having to ask for international assistance before setting up their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on unavoidable structural reforms that will bring confidence back to them in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to accelerate the process of normalizing sovereign bond markets.
Axel Weber, who was in transit in Paris on 24 November, was the first to come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, then the Union would not hesitate to reach back into its own pocket again.
The economists at Barclays Capital, a key player in the European sovereign debt market, estimate that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, & quot; preferably in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This remedy exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilization, which is currently EUR 60 billion.
An advisory board that has every chance of being scrutinised closely in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are tightening.
Snow and freezing ice: 24 Departments on orange alert
The snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in Brittany's secondary transport networks and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now on an orange alert due to the threat of snow and icy skies.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in orange alert level; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of Gironde as well as the Charentes. There is light snow on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow cover is expected from 2 to 5 cm, also from 7 to 10 cm in places, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Parisian region.
The regions affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d 'apos; Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are significant enough to cause traffic disruption and affect certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
In the Côtes d 'apos; Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy goods traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac traffic axes.
The traffic situation of Brittany's secondary transport networks is very difficult according to the traffic police, who advise against using your own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been canceled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic has been suspended for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture & quot; asks motorists to take the greatest care on the roads and to adjust their driving accordingly. & quot;
The Directorate General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris' Roissy airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that flight passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick airport in south London, as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial outlines
Billions have been raining since the debate about modernising the transport economy on Ile-de-France is in full swing.
At least in the discussions.
Consider in particular the $23 billion for the Grand Paris metro, to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To initiate the construction start of the SGP, the state has declared a capital dotation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend a portion of the financing sum at its twice in the markets.
Today, it has finally come to initial projections.
The 2010 supplementary budget, reviewed this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the foreseen measures to raise the first part of this money.
It is a dual action: the creation of a special tax for exploration and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
The former, so one extracts article 15 of the draft law, goes & quot; in favour of the public institution Société du Grand Paris & quot;.
This is quantified: & quot; The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year & quot;.
Second is a reordering of the already existing company taxation: & quot; to modernize this; to increase the product resulting from it; and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris; & quot;.
How much would that bring in?
A puzzle.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
You are far away from the 4 billion.
& quot; It is stated that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation raised by the state and that gradually the Société du Grand Paris will be paid for the project & quot; so it is inferred from the explanatory statement.
At the SGP one does not find this system at all offensive.
& quot; Since the moment you record income (the two taxes, i. a. R.), you can cover the project for three years and then only then draw from the $4 billion & quot; is explained.
& quot; This is quoted in the budget and subtracted gradually & quot;.
The SGP estimates that 2013 will start to quote the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions can still be found for a long time, runs the risk of provoking a quite eventful, parliamentary discussion.
The first public session will be on December 7th.
Vengeful hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks affair has a dual meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal. A scandal that is merely a scandal of sinister hypocrisy that governs the relations between the states, the citizens, and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's move forward in sequence.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the acknowledgement of the fact that every file created by an intelligence service (of any nation) is made up entirely of newspaper cuttings.
The & quot; extraordinary & quot;, American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits are nothing more than what was read for months anyway in any journal (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gadhafi' s alarmingly caricatured profile has long provided comedy artists with material for their sketches.
The rule according to which the secret files can only exist of news that is already known is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not just in this century.
If you go into a library devoted to esotherical publications, you will recognize that each work (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosary) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (nor because he does not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult do not believe in anything other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also Dan Brown's success mechanism.
Likewise the secret file.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) is also the head of the Secret Service (otherwise, he might be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who considers only what he acknowledges to be true.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why has such a fuss been made about the disclosures in these files?
On one page, these state what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then, the Heads of State or Government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few minor representational tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy to pretend to ignore this.
Still, the fact of repeating it in public hurts the task of hypocrisy, and serves to paint American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that a once-in-a-generation hacker can tap into the most secretive secrets of the world's most powerful country is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
What's more, the scandal puts the victims in distress rather than the & quot; executioners.
But let's address the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's day, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly correct since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel you visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But when you consider what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape a hacker's control, the control process ceases to be biased and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi's or Merkel' s character is basically a secret free from secrecy, since it divulges the public sphere; but to reveal, WikiLeaks-style, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets is to strip them of any power.
WikiLeaks did not do wrong to Sarkozy or to Merkel; it did wrong to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this insult, which has been inflicted on such a mighty power?
It's obvious that states will no longer put any reserved information online in the future - that would be tantamount to a notice stuck on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies it is futile to hope to be able to keep confidential reports about phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a leader of state moves around in an airplane and has contacted one of his or her colleagues.
How could certain relationships be maintained in the future, both private and for certain ears only?
I am well aware that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in secret ways, busily, along uncontrollable itineraries, carrying their communications nowhere else but in bare memory, and furthermore, hiding the little written information they have received, in the shoe heel.
The information would be stored in locked drawers in a single copy: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks'.
I had the opportunity to write that today's technology is advancing like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph using (telephone) wire.
The (analog) videocassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film tape by tape, by being able to rewind from back to front and unearth all the secrets of the montage, whereas the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, in macro proportions.
With the high-speed trains, you can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, including the transfer, this takes you three and a half hours.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to the car and horse.
One final observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what kind of secrets were forged between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that request confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France whitewashes its financial promises
A year after the Copenhagen accord, it is time to examine the fulfillment of the fast-solved financing promises (also called & quot; Fast start & quot; or premature financing) implemented by developing countries.
And already the rough French goodies are revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, while France has promised €1.26 billion (ie; €420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed procedure report of its member states, press conference, major fringe events, brochure distribution.
The Transparency operation is remarkable, and grades appreciated for its real value: developing countries and civil society would love it if all developed countries did the same thing at the same precision level.
The EU announces to have released EUR 2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track towards respecting its commitment of EUR 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the details, things are a bit more complicated.
This money, according to the Copenhagen Treaty, & quot; should be new and additional to & quot; to ensure that an additional deployment was brought in without prejudice to Official Development Assistance.
Sorry, there is no consensus on what & quot; means new and additionally & quot;.
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonisation, certain member states, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today everyone chooses the guideline they consider to be the best.
The EU Commission has chosen, for example, as an indicative for the 2009 one: international funding will be retained, adding $150 million over three years as part of the funding for & quot; Fast-start & quot;.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at the level of ODA.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of all new & quot; projects for the year 2010 was & quot; new and in addition to & quot;.
In other words, there are no indicative figures for the previous year's expenditure, or at the global level of Official Development Assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of French assistance to developing countries can remain stable (or decreases) - France pretends to abide by its commitment regarding the & quot; new and additional & quot; funding.
Another key element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule on that yet, and everyone chooses his arithmetic mode.
Some, such as France, have 1 borrowed €as equivalent with 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often carbon-containment projects based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro you are collecting as the equivalent of a donated euro... Also, only the cost of the loan for the donor country of capital should be counted as a commitment (i. e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind but the following consideration: it & quot; respects & quot; its obligation of 420 million Euros by borrowing 91.5% (389.8 million Euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million Euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only EU country to use loans on a large scale.
Germany demands 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) follow up their obligations with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France gives just 10 cents, understanding a comparable stake.
Nice hocus pocus!
All in all, France is operating with a double hoax in its near-start financing: one part with an evolution of the action over time and the other part with the reality of the financial deployment.
France succeeds in making us believe that it has spent 420 million & quot; new and additional & quot; million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros in the process.
The manipulation of the finance ministry (since it probably seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could result in a doubly negative effect; once intra-EU (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries cannot be completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question on relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions on the climate.
But it might be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that will not be the case.
Either way, it is imperative to learn his lesson from that first year of premature funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting method for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could advance the discussions on the subject of the dispute of long-term financing (another, crucial, and currently debated). You cannot escape the issue of & quot; creditability & quot; or the type of accounting on its loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive on issues of contention as it is on other things.
The hope is therefore based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about the fast-start of France and its vision of the & quot; accountability & quot; as well as use of loans would by nature raise the international trust base necessary for further discussion.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years takes various chemical substances over the day 81, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that given the small number of samples analyzed, their results do not reflect a statistically significant value, but rather an illustrative character of the problem in question, & quot;, between July and September, had purchased the foods usually consumed within four, by a child of about ten years of age, at mealtime, plus an intermediate meal at the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and veg pieces, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - were studied, as well as sweets from laboratories, in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The record is crushing: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic, and five classified as safely carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
& quot; may not exceed the legal limits for any chemical, individually used substance in the approximate totality of cases. However, it is very well inferred from this survey that the reality in which the user is possibly exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with an endocrine disruptor is worrisome, & quot; notes.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three that are safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, where the study found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
Also the minced steak, the tuna out of the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum were riddled with pesticides and other chemical substances.
For the tap water, the analyses have brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the most & quot; abundant with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unencumbered.
The ultimate risk of this & quot; pollutant cocktail & quot; for the consumer & quot; is likely to be undervalued & quot;, the study found.
The & quot; Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts & quot; (EE-LV), for its part, given the urgency of the situation & quot; has proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to halt the & quot; increase in the number of diseases of & quot;.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding the presence of residues had identified 365 different pesticides, identified in fruit and vegetables, that are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
