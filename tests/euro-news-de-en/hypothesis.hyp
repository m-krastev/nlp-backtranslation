What should it do, the ČSSD? Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort, nor does & quot; Konditorei & quot;.
The new councillors of the capital from the ČSSD ranks will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to comprehend their old-new ODS colleagues at all in the Prague Council and in the City Council.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz once knocked off members of the new ČSSD council a little & quot;, as they know the notorious slang that has become naturalized in recent years, where the present-day coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The coded vocabulary introduced by Prague's political elite in the bygone era of Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of Prague' s best known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it was revealed that the new Councils are somewhat in the dark with respect to the these new terms.
Or so they would have it.
& quot; Who is Voldemort? & quot;
& quot; No idea. & quot;
& quot; I am more of a novice in Prague politics & quot; Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councillor for Culture, reacted to the test of the & quot; godfather vocabulary & quot;.
But also the councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted in a similar way.
For example, to the term & quot; golhole & quot;.
& quot; This is the only expression of those you submit to me here, which I use every now and then. & quot;
& quot; Other than that, I don 't think much of slang. & quot;
From the vocabulary published by the journal Aktuálně.cz in June of this year, before the ODS election congress, the editors picked six terms, especially those notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms & quot; Voldemort & quot;, & quot; largest gollocke;, & quot; go to the pastry shop & quot;, & quot; bulls-neck & quot;, & quot; capital betrayal & quot; and & quot; sheet-metal & quot;.
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test. The fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised to participate in the conversation at first, but then did not even take off the handset.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
& quot; These things don 't matter to me, and how the Civic Democrats talk to each other, I do n' t judge about that. & quot;
& quot; For me, what's important is how we understand & quot; within the framework of our programs, he countered.
As already mentioned, Lukáš Kaucký would not have recognized in the above mentioned headline, that it's about the influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek.
The term & quot; Voldemort & quot; tells Kaucky purely nothing and the only word it correctly guessed during the test was the biggest Prague golfing hole & quot;.
& quot; This is the tunnel Blanka & quot; says Kaucký, but added for security: & quot; But I know this more from the newspaper. & quot;
And jokingly: & quot; I 'll probably have to take a language course. & quot;
The golfing hole is then deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina but also by Councillor Lukáš Plachý as Tunnel Blanka.
Both Social Democrats know who the term Voldemort stands for, and Lukáš Plachý even has a clue where this figure is to be found, and thereby what it is like to go & quot; into the pastry shop.
& quot; I think that means going into some Prague catering business & quot;, Plachý is quite close to the puzzle solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's firms.
Agreeing with Březina, however, he asserts to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary is his own.
In fact, judging by the test takers, there does not seem to be any similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
& quot; I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is really no such thing with us. & quot;
& quot; We call each other by name. Every now and then we use abbreviations or nicknames & quot;, says Prague ČSSD Chairman Petr Hulínský - called by his party comrades loosely & quot; Hulda & quot;.
& quot; At school I was called Bříza (Birch), but I do not know if my colleagues call me that & quot;, Karel Březina reveals his nickname to us.
The Deník newspaper tried the name and lo - it worked.
Councillor Weinert, to the party's partisans, is friendly to the & quot; Grandpa & quot; or, to a lesser extent, the & quot; Old & quot; Representative Miroslav Poche, who attracted attention for himself before the elections by machinations at party sponsorship, is called & quot; Igráček & quot; (well-known Czech Lego figure) by some colleagues.
Nicknames are thus the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in the intra-party parlance.
Hulínský allegedly does n 't like to be called & quot; Hulda & quot;, but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered another nickname of the Prague President as well.
His nickname & quot; Doctor of rubber-truncheon-rights & quot; is said to have to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský obtained his title of Doctor juris at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of & quot; witches & quot; and released a pamphlet
Women, who are labelled witches in Burkina Faso, usually exhibit some common social characteristics.
You are more likely to be of the older generation, unable to find a job - for health reasons, for example, they are single and do not have children.
If one of these women becomes a witch & quot; becomes & quot;, she becomes strictly isolated, so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
& quot; Men are very rarely affected by this fate. & quot;
& quot; Also young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with the work and give birth to children & quot; describes the situation, which cares for in the capital of the west African state Burkina Faso in a special home more than 100 women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government decided to proceed against this abnormal & quot; social measure & quot;.
And for this reason, a brochure was published, which is supposed to prevent the & quot; witch persecution & quot;.
There is a catch though.
& quot; More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read & quot;, the newspaper pointed out & quot; the Standard & quot; to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
But being accused of witchcraft is common in other African countries as well.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they doused her with petroleum and simply set it alight.
This incident was reported by the BBC server, among others.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the affair was just a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is aflame, which is used for ritual anointings.
This is after the group tried to drive out & quot; an evil ghost from the wife & quot;, & quot; told & quot;.
Isolation of & quot; witches & quot; supports the people here without regard to their education.
& quot; The Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso on this subject. & quot; eaters human souls, sooner than today, are a danger to & quot;, he said.
While the Burkina Faso government is at least trying to defuse the witch-hunt, the Gambian President has duly joined the President himself in the past year.
& quot; President Yahya. Jammeh unleashed a monstrous witch-hunt after his aunt's death. They allegedly participated in her death and would now try to kill the president themselves with black magic. & quot;
& quot; To this end, he called for the help of shamans from nearby Guinea. Accompanied by police officers, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, they abducted women and men at random from Gambian villages and brought them to the president' s farm in Kanilai, according to the organization Amnesty International in its report.
On the farm, the imprisoned people were forced to drink a decoction of plants with hallucinogenic effects, but which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the trapped people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only due to international pressure that the nearly thousand prisoners were released again.
A Bakala tenant: He heats in the furnace though - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly stocky man is just leaving the Client Centre of the company RPG Byty of the & quot; coal baron & quot; Zdeněk. Bakala, the largest private owner of rental flats in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new lease contracts on three flats: for his own and the flats of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three have just increased their rents as part of the so-called & quot; deregulation.
Instead of 3500 kronor monthly rent, the son is to spend 4100 kronor next year on a two-room apartment with a second-category kitchen.
& quot; And since the apartment does not even have running hot water and you have to heat in a simple coal-fired furnace & quot;, he taps his finger angrily on the son's new lease agreement, which he has a power of attorney to sign.
& quot; But what - I signed & quot;, he declares, half-mad and half-resigned.
The civic association BytyOKD.cz, which called the new lease conditions "quot; incorrect and immoral & quot;", advised the tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and to wait until December 7th, when it intends to publish a manual on how to proceed against such contracts.
But the man is just waving off.
& quot; One says this, the other the & quot;, he makes a gloomy face.
Thus, the Ostrava region becomes the great & quot; deregulation laboratory.
After New Year, this deregulation is about to happen to most rental homes in the Czech Republic whose tenants have not yet paid rent in line with the market.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this & quot; lab in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region, and is already at breaking point at nine o 'clock this Tuesday morning.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency, and a calling device next to them.
& quot; Rent 2011 & quot;, then a special keyboard will light up on the touch screen.
Touched briefly and the device is already spitting out a number sheet.
Hardly have we deciphered the number & quot; 157 & quot; and it is already beeping on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
It is your turn half a second later.
A little later, an older couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent at all.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance issues and the like.
From mid-November, in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new lease contracts flutter into the letter boxes of most of the RPG's total of 44,000 apartments portfolio tenants.
The RPG Byty in the letters proposes to them a rent increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The special counter for the new rents in the client center has been open since November 18th.
& quot; The action is running a little over a week, that is, this is just the beginning & quot;, the ladies behind the counter answer after a moment of hesitation when the & quot; client & quot; turns out to be a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former miners' flats are a hot topic.
Prior to the elections, the Ostrava-born Parliamentary Vice President Lubomír Zaorálek of ČSSD was quite vocal in raising this issue. No wonder newspapers are full of them today.
& quot; Twenty years I want a new floor from them. & quot;
& quot; Not even ne besch. Toilet Glasses could change them & quot;, the aforementioned man frets.
Until now, according to the female staff, mainly pensioners are queuing at the counter to convince themselves whether they really get the promised tenant discount that RPG promises them if they sign the special offer in time.
The remaining tenants who sign the new lease until 15 December will also benefit from half the February rent.
So far, & quot; deregulation switch & quot; in Havířov is anything but overloaded with requests, however.
& quot; Of Yesterday's 360 Clients Only About 40 To 50 Hold the Rent Due To 2011 Here Hire & quot;, Settings Officers Estimate
RPG offers individual lease agreements where necessary, both on its websites and on blackboards.
However, if the lease parties fail to agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
& quot; This is not to be a threat, but it is to be understood as information about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal course of action & quot; is taking, explains RPG on its web pages.
& quot; Nobody is going to court here, says one of the female RPG Byty staff members. A man on the street in front of the client center at least partly agrees with her.
& quot; I have 13,000 (kronor) pension, of which I have 5,000 left over for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute & quot; means.
Then the employee becomes unsafe.
& quot; Let's see. & quot;
& quot; Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media, they are not supposed to sign and so people are still waiting for & quot;, she admits.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year '2011, and according to RPG Byty the rent increase is an economic necessity.
& quot; The existing amount of rents is not enough even to maintain the housing fund, & quot; argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty. It is precisely the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the enraged tenants that is in the opinion of the landlords the main reason for the rent increase.
Whereas RPG was able to invest four billion out of the rent received into the flats in the years between 2005 and 2010. In the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is supposed to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-sized LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the Havířov waiting room, a few luminous red information pops up from time to time.
& quot; The rent increases of 15% or less in 2011 affect 31,200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of the RPG apartments.
& quot; always means at most 7.50 CZK per square meter per month & quot; read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio, the rent increases by 38 per cent.
& quot; In these cases it's about raising extremely low rent prices from 19.66 CZK per square meter & quot;, argues RPG.
At 2600 apartments, next year's rent will remain at the same level.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not cause rents to rise by leaps and bounds, but will be phased in four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes on itself another obligation: Any income from the tenant increase (see chart) wants to put the company back into the apartments, mainly in heat savings - in new windows and in thermal insulation.
But - primarily, this should be for the benefit of those people who sign the lease increase agreements.
The architects saw one - a kindergarten also belongs to the office
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design
But who would expect a mini-kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: brightly colored walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys, and even a mini-playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff members since last year.
The design and architecture firm Arch.Design, whose studios date from a number of well-known Brno builders, calculated from the very first designs for the new Avriopoint building that it would accommodate its corporate mini-kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of its 90 staff members are in baby boom age, and the company is anxious that the project-goers and architects return to their jobs as soon as possible.
Along with the possibility of working shorter, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers and architects thus have an easier time reconciling their demanding jobs and child welfare.
The mini-kindergarten is an original idea of the employees of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they were able to win European Union and Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs funding for their project.
The operational mini-kindergarten is financed through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from funds of the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (grants amounting to CZK 2.8 million), it was possible to procure the necessary equipment and equipment, and for the duration of 2 years, qualified personnel and operation will be provided.
After the funds have been used up (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue running the mini-kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year to complete, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the application processing.
Full-time qualified personnel - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher - takes care of the children. Children may visit the kindergarten without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is a mini-kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time. However, several children take turns during the day.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly tuned to the needs of the parents. The children of all employees have the same rights with regard to the use of kindergarten - regardless of the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although this is individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is still comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Not only do children play here, but above all they are provided with excellent instruction - from basic knowledge to pre-school instruction, along the way they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a calculator that is at the children's disposal.
What's more, the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company milieu.
Parents can have a look at the children at any time. This eliminates the stress of being late to pick up the children from a far-flung kindergarten.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
Arch. Design thus ranked among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, which are family friendly, and through such programs strengthen their personnel marketing.
A bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the staircase like the vertebral column of a dinosaur, and the balconies are cracked fish mouths.
This is Barcelona's Casa Batlló by Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi.
From the local inhabitants the house with its organic shapes got the nickname & quot; Bone House & quot;.
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile chips and mosaics, the scale-like façades and omnipresent soft lines - all these are characteristics typical of the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, delicate colors and textures that recall nature and creatures.
Only on closer inspection do you notice that everything is controlled by geometry, rhythm, and well thought out order.
At night, the whole façade is even more three-dimensional, dramatic, and the special lighting adds to the brightness of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and intricate forms dominate the interior of the house as well.
Wavy shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and moldings.
House Batlló is located in the Eixample district, on the busy shopping street of Number 43, Passeig de Grácia. It is the result of a renovation of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
Reconstruction took two years to complete and was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old one and building an entirely new one, but ultimately agreed to Gaudí's idea of an unusual and also cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Casa Batlló apartment building was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked together with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
It was on this drawing board that the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of reality were created, and also the use of mosaics on the façade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists and artists also contributed to the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol was also involved in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá in Güell Park, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Already shortly after its completion the house got the nickname & quot; bone house & quot; from the local inhabitants for its organic forms.
Others called it 'quot;' due to its special window opening mechanism, while others called it the 'quot; gaping house'.
It is also said that at the very top of the building there is a picture of the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia.
But also other sculptural elements symbolise hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed for the house a central heating system unique for the time, with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces.
Their 45-degree tilt already looks a bit bizarre.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building regulations of the time and was not at all deterred by these.
Before building started, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he gave about the planned reconstruction was so vague that two years later, when it was completed, the city fathers were so appalled by the outcome that they demanded redress.
Among other things, the councillors also clashed on the fact that the building with its pillars even encroached on the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the opposite - just fifteen days after the district requested it to do so, Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two tallest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted them.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery on the 2nd floor there was a social salon. On the 3rd floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the flat.
The ground floor has been leased to a jewellery shop.
The entire six-story building traverses a set of stairs leading up to the roof terrace.
By the basic elements of the rebuild all right angles and straight lines have been eliminated and replaced with curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept of the interconnection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the salon doors, allowing a larger company to chat comfortably, without sacrificing some intimacy for more intimate conversations.
In addition to a new façade, Gaudí's reconstruction also gave the house a rather unusual roof and two additional floors.
Gaudí's play on light is also impressive, as are the blue and white glazed tiles covering the courtyard and the courtyards.
Play of these two colors gives maximum light to all floors of the house.
He simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects light better than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
The Casa Batlló, which was included in Unesco's World Heritage List in 2005, can be visited by anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and sumptuous apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners decided to take this step only in the year, on the occasion of the famous creator's 150th birthday.
When it was realized that this is a fairly lucrative business, it retained the tours, and even extended them to other common and attic spaces, including the roof terrace.
The price for a visit to the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 Euro. Students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the admission fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Whoever wants to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its little dragon turrets should try to make friends with one of the householders and visit him at home.
The right mattress and bed rust? Women have different wishes than men
Not the nicest bed frame, but the quality of the bed surface - that is, the mattress and the rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to satisfy the wishes of the actual user.
There are a lot of things that play a role in the selection - the weight, the height, the state of health and last but not least the gender of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which the mattress and grating have to be subordinated to each other.
Typical example?
In a weekend house that does not get heated regularly, latex mattresses are n 't well suited, as they take a lot longer to get & quot; warm & quot;.
In addition, they are considerably heavier than common polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be rotated regularly.
If they do n 't have enough venting channels in the core, and they also lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that mould develops underneath it.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the choice.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will find it hard to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
& quot; Probably all of the ice hockey players who returned from the NHL have complained to me that they can 't sleep properly here anymore. & quot;
& quot; For their slimmed-off shoulders, heels, and hips, they just need a soft layer of Visco foam (a memory-foam shape-memory polymer). & quot;
& quot; This I recommend, among other things, people with diabetes who suffer from a nervous system disorder, so that they can receive the & quot; information from the joints and skin hard & quot;, explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Therefore, I have already purchased Visco memory foam on many hockey players, but also on other customers, many years ago.
& quot; Today, this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer among others the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico. & quot;
And you do n 't necessarily need to be a famous ice hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This & quot; miracle & quot; actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it literally clings to the warm body.
Nowhere does it push, at night you do not roll around like you would after a heavy fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (gangren).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should always add the length of the soles of your feet to your height, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Both men and women, who are about 180 cm tall, so need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should have at least 90 cm of lying width available to them, which means that together they should have 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of convenience and also for eventual visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal width of the bed: if you are lying on your back, there should be enough space for your slightly bent arms, advises Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholstery and interior decorators, who has devoted herself for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture. She also lectures on this topic at specialist colleges.
With a double bed, everyone needs a grate and their own mattress, but watch out when shopping so the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise there is nothing else left but to mount the grates in different heights and this is not possible for every bed frame by a long way.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high. Mattresses should have a spring skeleton of 15 cm. At least three inches of this should fall onto the shape layer and fine cushion.
& quot; With the hand or while sitting down, you must not feel the springs in any way, & quot; Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of grate.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and base like Siamese twins grown together have no place in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already quite common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 litres of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress will slowly become a giant (and clogged) colander.
This is one reason why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifespan of up to 25 years, and even a lifetime guarantee, for mattresses.
Each thing has its ifs and buts.
And hence a practical piece of advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width one should not be afraid of the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, nevertheless it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which you can easily peel and wash.
Even though today mattress covers are usually made with a full-length zipper, so that you get two halves after opening them (immensely important for the washing process and the size of the washing machine!), manipulation with larger mattresses, especially when done alone, often looks like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do you have a fixed panel in bed instead of a grid?
Get Out!
Or at most one bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Also in this way you should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none already in it) and use mattresses with a spring skeleton and a minimum height of 15 cm with so-called pocket spring core and fine padding.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
For non-adjustable slats with 14 to 18 spring bars (fins) latex or sandwich mattresses (optionally also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable. Always pay off slats with a larger number of slats, that is 28 and more spring bars, with lumbar support in the lumbar vertebrae area and the possibility of regulating the hardness of the slats.
No mattresses with a spring skeleton belong on adjustable slat grates, as they do not react to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring bars, special flexible shoulder modules are offered.
This is about a special attachment of the spring bars, which makes possible to press or even to bend the bars in a way that they allow the punctual sinking of the sleeper's shoulder.
Especially for men with wide shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use & quot; soft zones for the shoulder area in & quot; men's mattresses.
Also to the ladies is thought - you treat them to these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing springs (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion springs are intended.
The pressure is distributed over several points, which reduces the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and bulky) pillow for the right mattress and the right rust, most advantages are lost again.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders for the shoulder muscles to relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large cushion, as the Scandinavians like it, appears ideal.
When lying on the side, the head cushion (together with the shoulder-relief zone in the rust or the soft-zone in the mattress) should compensate for shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the old straw sacks (filled with hay).
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magic word is & quot; Bio & quot;.
Natural oils are increasingly being used to produce polyurethane foams, for example, castor and soya oil, instead of crude oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
& quot; For mattresses, & quot; organic means that their core is composed of materials of purely natural origin, explains Petr Vašíček of Tropico Plus.
Natural fabrics are also used to make mattress covers. One of the first was Aloe Vera.
You can also treat yourself to microcapsules that give off the scent of fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
Again, you make a difference between man and woman.
Whereas for men, a & quot; cooling & quot; plant extract of birch leaves is used, so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body. For women, the covers have a & quot; warming & quot; effect.
Red pepper pods extracts stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets pleasingly warm when they sleep.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathable than standard polyurethane, and also much more flexible).
Combining the different stiffnesses of cold foams and Visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels are.
However, for a high-quality mattress you have to fork 7000 kronor or more.
However, health mattresses are usually loaded with less VAT as they are considered to be medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to be given this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
From time to time there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
So the Magniflex brand is offering the Duofreeze mattress with Visco foam Memory covered in a cover for CZK 11,990.
You get the second for free.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of visco-elastic foams with an open cell structure and high density, at an almost cosmic tempo.
No wonder, since they were designed for NASA. The astronauts are extremely overloaded during launches.
Tempur becomes soft when it is warm, and solidifies in a cool environment.
It adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure burn, but also generally increases the comfort of sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, however, they are also used for other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are said to provide relief to the legs and vessels.
Native manufacturers use the Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products, for example.
More and more parents want human-monitoring devices to keep kids under control
The fear around your own children is growing, and so more and more parents consider monitoring them via GPS.
The system originally invented to track cars can actually locate people just as well, which would be helpful in such cases as the recent disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette packet, but it is not expected to be any bigger than a wristwatch any time soon.
Many people have been terrified by the case of the vanished anička, so they are on the lookout for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an infringement of your privacy.
& quot; We try to tell everyone that this is not about spying at all, but rather is an effective means to reduce the chance of tragedy, & quot; cites Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS positioning equipment to the Czech market.
& quot; I admit that in individual cases there may be misuse of such devices, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing about it, but we have n' t had such a case to date. & quot;
& quot; most customers really buy it for security reasons & quot;, adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what the purpose of the & quot; box is & quot;, and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that when a child does not like to wear such a thing, he or she simply gets rid of it.
& quot; Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to intentionally losing certain things when they do n 't want to be controlled. & quot;
& quot; Even mobile phones raised parents' expectations at first, but they can be turned off just as easily as these new & quot; monitors, says Ms. Bočková.
In your opinion, it is also debatable whether such a device actually helps in case of an attack.
& quot; With scheduled kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks to see if the child has any electronics with him that could be used to locate him.
& quot; Today it is the Mobile Phone.
& quot; If such monitoring devices were more widely used, they would seek them as well, since their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising. & quot;
& quot; In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police, & quot; says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in the face of a sudden attack by a paedophile.
Roberta Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which provides location services for both automobiles and people, says that even if such a device is destroyed immediately after the attack, its existence can still help.
& quot; The device can be set up in a way that it reports the respective position in certain intervals. & quot;
& quot; Even if it would be destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the affected person is available. & quot;
& quot; With more expensive devices, even an inclinometer is built in, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning indicating the position of & quot;, claims Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do smart mobile phones with navigation, one only has to import a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that they are either match-sized devices that look like pendants, or smaller phones.
Always there is a danger of losing them.
This is why, according to Mr Pilin of the Weil Macro, devices that look like normal digital clocks are currently being tested.
& quot; This has the advantage that the eventual attacker does n 't need to realize at all that it' s about a monitoring or locating device.
& quot; Or it notices this only after a certain amount of time has passed, giving the police a time lead over & quot;, it adds.
No matter what direction the evolution goes - towards wristbands or tags, the same technology is always used as for vehicle localization.
So to combine the locate function using the GPS system (same as for in-car navigation) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses you could wrap all of the Czech Republic around it, but it only lasts for two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of fuses to be detonated with explosive devices.
The previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already supplied 224 kilometres of fuse to Army camps.
It is reassuring to know that the Armed Forces have kept records for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cables - two, but no more than four years.
The army bought the fuses from the public company STV Group, a. s., for a paltry 40 million kronor.
In its justification for buying this huge amount of fuse, General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume about 60 kilometers of fuse annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians MF DNES addressed to this, this statement indicates that the whole army would have to undergo an extremely intense pyrotechnic training every year - from all the generals and officers of the Army Command, down to the secretaries and cleaners.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not excluded.
Only in this way can the remarkable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be reasonably justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations by the way.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of pundits is that two feet of fuse is all it takes to train a new professional soldier, then the Army has built itself a calming supply store for the 225 years already mentioned, thanks to these new purchases - also in view of the increased demand of the Pioneers and Special Forces.
Soldiers of the Rapid Response Brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense, Mr. Vondra, that they nearly ran out of cartridges for handguns, so shooting drills are severely limited because of the lack of resources.
Not to mention the underpants shortage.
& quot; Nor does it occur to me why they buy such huge quantities of cords from us. & quot;
But this is ultimately their decision, they will already know what they need it for. & quot;
& quot; For us, the Army is a good customer. As a retailer, we want to come as close as possible to & quot;, says STV Group Sales Manager Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman of the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of fuse by saying that the army had thus at least covered itself for ten years with this & quot; ammunition & quot;.
Jan Děcký of the STV Group, however, speaks only of a four-year service life for the detonators, and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
& quot; With perfect storage the mentioned four years are probably also possible & quot; admits one of them. However, one of them wants to remain unnamed so as not to be accused as a soldier of criticizing the army.
After the service life expires, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested to see if it is still reliable and does not endanger soldiers' lives.
However, these tests are not free of charge, they cost extra money.
Another Defense Department argument is the quantity discount for the 445 kilometer fuse.
& quot; You cost us sixty percent less than last year's 244-kilometer-long delivery of & quot;, Spokesperson Pejšek informs us of the Defense Department purchaser' s point of view.
Just for comparison, annual consumption of detonators by police pyrotechnicians liquidating ammunition from World War II, or the Soviet Brotherhood Army, has barely exceeded 1,500 feet for several years.
And the police always orders only those quantities of this ammunition they can use before the end of the service life.
Already because of the security of the pyrotechnicians, besides one keeps the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and therefore also reliable ignitors open.
The Ministry of Defence is already experiencing huge problems with liquidating tens of thousands of tonnes of ammunition from the time the Warsaw Treaty was signed, when the Czechoslovak People's Army of two hundred thousand was preparing for its campaign on the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians mentioned by MF DNES, in a few years the Czech armed forces will face the same problem in liquidating hundreds of kilometers of old fuses that they bought so cheaply & quot; today.
To this day, I still like the contacts I got thanks to the contest
The winning placement in the & quot; Small Entrepreneur of the Year contest helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
Last year's winner of the & quot; Small Business of the Year & quot; competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success looks like a movie scene.
Lukáš Pytloun liked travelling.
It was only abroad that he realised that Liberec lacks good accommodation at reasonable prices.
Using the savings from his holiday working abroad, and using a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five flats.
Considering that he was a sixth-semester college student at the time, this was certainly a courageous move.
& quot; The price-quality ratio at that time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it, & quot; says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately reinvested all the profits back into the house, which he subsequently converted step by step into the 54-bed guesthouse.
Since then, in only seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has succeeded in opening four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was, until recently, the four-star & quot; Pytloun Design Hotel.
Another first-class hotel was added this year.
& quot; Just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé. We sold our franchise concept to it and other interested parties in the franchise of Pytloun hotels have already contacted & quot;, says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
& quot; Large share of this license sale to operate hotels was just the victory in the & quot; Entrepreneur of the Year contest, & quot; adds Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
& quot; People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well & quot;, he remembers.
I really recommend this contest to anyone who wants to create something.
You don 't need to win immediately, either. Every visualization is good.
He says that he is still taking advantage of the contacts and acquaintances that would otherwise not have happened at all.
& quot; With some people whom I met thanks to the contest, I still maintain regular business relations to this day. & quot;
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also has a little impact on each of his collaborators a bit.
And since he has about seventy.
& quot; I notice more loyalty and pride in them being part of something that gets universal recognition. & quot;
I also really do not regard this only as personal success, no, this is the result of the good work done by us all. & quot;
& quot; My name has only moved slightly to the foreground & quot;, says Lukáš. Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the aftermath of the crisis.
Thanks to his single-mindedness, Farmet has the worst behind it.
The award for the first place in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the past year was presented to Karel Žďárský, owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury appreciated the efforts with which he trampled out of the small tool shop in Česká Skalice a company that makes hundreds of millions of turnovers.
& quot; I can say that this appreciation has emboldened not only me but also all my co-workers and strengthened our self-confidence in the battle with the competition & quot; says the last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history there was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered Karel Žďárský, his father, a small workshop for rent as compensation for the property confiscated by the Communists, he did not hesitate for a long time, letting go of his career in the company where he had worked up to then, and founded, together with a few of his father's comrades, his own company for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later they started focusing on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it is only through success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it has entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
& quot; Not only because our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensely, but also our foreign partners began to attach greater value to the fact that they could collaborate with a company that has achieved the greatest success possible in their country, says Karel Žďárský.
The past year, however, was not only about victory euphoria.
The appraisal was based on the Company's 2008 financial results and a portion of 2009 financial results.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for selling tool making products.
The crisis, which shook then even less the citizens, but mainly businesses, was just reaching its climax - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchasing of new facilities and technologies.
& quot; Of course, we could not escape this situation either. & quot;
& quot; sales fell 40 percent, we had to cut production and even resort to layoffs & quot; explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular action as well.
It succeeded, however, in getting a handle on the situation and keeping the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
For one, the company was not willing to make any sacrifices - for investment in research and development.
& quot; From the grant we built a research and training center, we reinforced our presentation at international fairs and won top prizes at domestic exhibitions & quot; says Žďárský.
Everything indicates that we have overcome the crisis.
Turnover increases again, and with them the number of new employees.
& quot; To the new victor I wish a lot of joy in the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere & quot; lets Karel Žďárský align.
An opinion poll tidying up nonsense rules
The opinion poll about the & quot; absurdity of the year & quot; is, for the fourth time, part of the entrepreneurship contest.
Some nonsensical rules succeeded already to remove from the world.
& quot; became the dubious winner of the next volume of the opinion poll, & quot; Absurdities of the Year advanced the duty to create documents on authorities available online.
Thus, more than one-third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration requested a paper copy from the Commercial Register, even if the civil servant could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the poll, this is now changing.
& quot; The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require excerpts from the Commercial Register when conducting checks on Social Security payers, said ČSSZ spokeswoman Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the poll quot; & quot; Absurdity of the Year quot; is to scrutinize all the regulations and dispositions that entrepreneurs have to fulfill in the Czech Republic, and to repeal the nonsensics ones.
This is the fourth time this year that this is part of an entrepreneur competition organized by the Czech Business Newspaper (HN). It is growing in popularity among the public.
If there were about three thousand people voting last year, there were four thousand people this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to impede the business activity.
& quot; For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we are ranked first in the world, notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying entrepreneurial activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has barely improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74th in terms of business conditions, down eight places on the previous year.
The Absurdity of the Year contest was first held in the year, and takes place each year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the contest's editorial deadline at the end of September.
For registration, the web address www.firmaroku.cz. The organizer then selects seven candidates for the & quot; Anti-Prize & quot;. The public can vote on the Internet at www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The winner is the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than one hundred, or to be more precise 105, meaningless rules and arrangements were already registered for this year's poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated & quot; finalists are & quot; of the competition. Such are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and expressways have to pay toll, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must set up every two years.
The directory of this year's & quot; seven & quot; is published on the competition pages.
The proclamation of the contest at the beginning of November on Prague's Wenceslas Square is part of a happening that is regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Tradeswoman of the Czech Republic, and Petr Kužel, President of the Czech Republic Chamber of Commerce, were on hand for the highlight of the competition.
& quot; Where the state is throwing cudgels at the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic recovery. Therefore, my goal is to repeal at least thirty paragraphs a year, which today would unnecessarily complicate entrepreneurs' businesses, said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to remove nonperforming orders from the world are having an effect.
In 2007 people were most annoyed by the obligation imposed on entrepreneurs to report to the trade office at the place of their permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to go with an exhibition booth to an exhibition or fair place.
This obligation was removed by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation that received the second most votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labor Office business trips of employees up to 30 days - was abolished by the law on them so called the & quot; green card.
And - all good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation was chosen. It required physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two bathroom scales in the consulting room.
This regulation was somewhat mitigated by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator duty fell away.
A New Category Honors Socially Responsible Companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the Business Journal (HN) contest is the & quot; Responsible Company of the Year 2010 category.
The basic idea of this contest is to promote sound and fair business.
& quot; We would like to support those companies that are aware of the environmental consequences of your business activities and support socially responsible initiatives & quot; says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafone. They are the crier and guarantor of this contest, as well as the & quot; Rebel of the Year & quot; contest.
For this year's first year of this special sub-category of the main Vodafone Company of the Year contest, companies signed up for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The history of each of them is extremely inspiring, and provides enough material for a standalone article.
Although they differ diametrically in terms of the subject of their activity, their efforts nonetheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is for example about handicapt people, there about personal problems or the health of own coworkers.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, there was Et Netera, a software company based in Prague, which encourages the creation of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main sponsor of a handicaped children's foundation for seventeen years.
Also a paper mill from Poděbrady takes an exemplary look at its health handicapped employees, who make up 70 percent of its workforce. For this it was awarded the title & quot; Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region & quot; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition it came in third place within this region.
In the Olomouc region, the winner was the accounting firm MiRyz Soft, which introduced, among other things, a fluent working hours and also reduced it to an average of 35 hours per week, and this without a proportional reduction in wages.
In awarding the title, the jury also honoured the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizen initiatives in their environment and works according to eco-friendly principles.
& quot; We strive to recycle as much as possible to minimize the impact of our entrepreneurial activities and administration on the environment, & quot;'s CEO Miluše Ryznarová explains.
For its part, responsible IT company Enlogit from Ústí nad Labem region is concerned about the health of its employees and therefore it has bought them ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all laptops. In addition, it promotes homework among its employees and uses cartering services provided by a protected home workshop for company promotions.
& quot; also supports the & quot; People in Need Foundation, which provides concrete help to the local Roma community, & quot; says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company & quot; Praní a čištění & quot; from Karlovy Vary Region is worth mentioning. It contributes its employees to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
& quot; We give our employees contributions for food, for commuting, for raising their qualifications and for holidays, says Josef Strapáč from building company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
To the Responsible Company of the Year category, all district finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year contest were automatically entered. They would answer the questions of the questionnaire attached to the registration and send it to the organizer no later than August 15.
Wrong or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
& quot; If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they would be excluded from the & quot; Responsible Company of the Year & quot; Contest. However, in the Vodafone Company of the Year Main Contest, they would not be disqualified for doing so. & quot;
& quot; A separate registration only to this contest is not possible since it is only a subcategory of the main contest Company of the Year, declares Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & amp; Rose.
Pilsner Soil Fund - Arrests of the police during a public tender
Anti-corruption police made arrests at the Ground Fund building in Pilsen in recent days.
In the process local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was led away in handcuffs by the detectives.
This had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition for the settlement of restitution claims, so that the properties offered in the competition fell to a concrete interested party.
The latter allegedly paid Luboš G. half a million for this.
& quot; At this time, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person for the offence of fraudulent conduct in a public contest & quot; said Antonie Zelená, chief of the Pilsen prosecutor's office of the newspaper & quot; Právo & quot;. She could not provide further details in view of the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by police again.
The way in which he was able to manipulate the public contest can only be speculated about in view of the scant official information.
Lubomír Černá Land Fund spokeswoman, responding to Právo's question on this subject, stated that police did indeed make arrests in the Plzeň Land Fund branch, during a public competition.
& quot; It was about a client and by no means one of our staff & quot;, she concretized.
The public competition had, according to Ms. Černá, the correct designation & quot; call for bidding of claims for the transfer of plots under the & quot; Soil Act, and would take place in cases where several applicants expressed interest in the offered plots.
& quot; These persons offer, as part of the request, a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by transfer than the declared land value. & quot;
& quot; According to the claims offered, the order of the potential purchaser is determined. Subsequently, the ground fund transfers the plot to the person with the highest bid & quot;, explains the spokeswoman of the fund.
Luboš G. was obviously giving information about who had signed up at the request, and being a legitimate person himself, having purchased a number of redemption rights, he offered to a real estate dealer that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat compensation.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had too good contacts to the Pilsen Soil Fund in the past.
Thus, he also played a role in the cause of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing, in replacement restitutions, parcels of land that had already been subject to site decisions on building projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the Land Fund purchased, for example, land destined for the construction of public roads, more precisely, in the place where the access highway to the Borské pole industrial estate was planned to be built.
Later he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historical center of the city, which exceeded the value of the plots by far.
At that time, the town hall had to give up Kleinbeichen with a heavy heart, in order not to jeopardize the building project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs are rising by a few hundred a month
Households will not only have to face higher costs for all types of energy from January onwards, but they will also face higher water and waste charges, and for district heating and in some places rents are rising as well.
Families will thus be forced to withdraw several hundred kronor a month from their wallets from January onwards.
Electricity becomes up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas up 2 percent and more. In some cities you will have to pay up to one tenth more for water supplies, and in some places district heating is also becoming more expensive.
Electricity alone will cost home households several hundred kronor more each year.
The star power prices have been lowered by all of the main suppliers, so it is the significant boost to renewable power generation, especially from photovoltaics, that is to say.
Gas will only become moderately more expensive, but this is when people need to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here, too, one has to reckon with a few hundred kronor per year more.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the Czech Republic, prices for district heating vary from city to city.
Especially larger places schedule price increases.
For example, from January onwards, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 kn a month more for district heating. Families in Liberec will have to pay more than 1000 kn a year more.
On the other hand, the inhabitants of Prague are threatened with 9 percent higher water and sewage charges in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 per cent.
The price in Prague is, however, still among the lowest in comparison to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In Northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are due to increase by 7.4 percent.
Huge rental price increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental properties, where the so-called Rent Regulation will be omitted from January onwards.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by one hundred percent starting in January.
If you do not agree to the rent increase, the company will take you to court.
Regulated rents, which are still around 300,000 homes today, are expected to increase by more than 10 per cent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with fernet and rum beer is out - it just looks too slow
Fernet, Rum and Vodka. For once a good whisky was stolen from the father's house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most often need emergency treatment.
No exception are children who have to sleep off their hangover repeatedly in hospital.
This comes from the experience of doctors facing similar cases in the admission of children's departments of clinics.
& quot; beer or wine are totally out of fashion, because it just takes too long to get drunk. & quot;
& quot; The current trend is definitely hard alcohol. & quot; said Právo Luděk Pelikán. Chief pediatrician in the Central Bohemian Hospital Hořovice.
& quot; Whisky, if it succeeds in stealing a bottle from the house bar from your father, and if not, at least Fernet or Vodka.
& quot; Vodka has the advantage of being able to mix it with Juice, then it does not smell as strong & quot;, explains the chief physician.
Faculty Hospital spokeswoman, Motol Eva Jurinová, agrees.
& quot; Most often it's about Fernet or Rum. & quot;
& quot; This is today's alcohol trend, especially at elementary school. & quot;
& quot; was also about Slibowitz, which you take from your home, Ms. Jurinová said.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are by no means an exception in the hospital admission.
Before the Hořovice clinic, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the paediatrics department at Motol hospital, where ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
& quot; A girl had to be hospitalized four times. & quot;
& quot; Her career began at the age of 12, when she was first admitted with 3.5 promille of alcohol in her blood, and in combination with & quot; Extase & quot;, the doctor described a particularly severe case.
& quot; She was at some dance party in the exhibition grounds in Holešovice.
& quot; The interesting thing about this was that it did n 't seem strange to your mother at all, that your daughter did n' t come home for 48 hours, & quot; s chief physician marvels.
It is precisely the parents' lack of interest, or their incredible tolerance when toasting with their offspring that is said to be one of the main causes of children's growing alcoholism.
A real addiction in the true sense of the word is not what children are about, according to experts.
& quot; Alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependency on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case for these children.
In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, a negative family-social background is most characteristic of & quot;, explains Pelikán's chief physician.
By mid-November, according to the Motol hospital spokeswoman, Ms. Jurinová, approximately forty drunken children were admitted to the local pediatric and adolescent medicine department.
However, only those cases of severe alcohol poisoning that required hospitalization are included in the statistics.
Drunk children, brought home after out-patient treatment by parents or, as appropriate, the police, are not registered.
Apart from the cases where children only drink one bottle of liquor in the school bench once in a while, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes that can be 100% relied upon: Walpurgis night, New Year's Eve, and the end of the school year.
& quot; The latter for two reasons - either out of grief over the bad testimony or out of joy at the holidays.
& quot; On Walpurgis Night, I have also experienced seven drunken children at once in the recording & quot;, emphasizes Doctor Pelikán.
Paradoxically, a drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is better off than a child who only has to contend with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
In fact, the morning after headache resulting from dehydration and lack of glucose can be dispelled in the hospital with a fluid-giving infusion of glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
& quot; You are clearly better off because, after the & quot; wonderful & quot; experience in the evening, you wake up in a good mood, with no hurt anywhere. & quot;
& quot; You are just a bit confused about where they are & quot;, admits Doctor Pelikán. Sometimes, he at least spoils the patient's good mood by telling them the cost they will have to pay for the treatment.
Because the transport with the ambulance and the night in an acute bed come up well and gladly on a few tens thousand crowns.
& quot; Now and then I have used this as a means of education when I calculated directly to the children on the visit what their drunkenness cost and that it may well happen that they have to work all the time during the holidays in order to earn the money for a single such party & quot;, added Doctor Pelikán;
However, according to his opinion, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse to claim the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two L-159 training aircraft in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two L-159 light combat aircraft out of a total of five that the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced with the Casa C-295M transport aircraft flew on Tuesday into the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is based.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
To date, they have only been seen at manoeuvres or air shows abroad.
This is the airworthy two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The other three aircraft are single-seat L-159 aircraft.
These are currently still conserved in the Aero Vodochody. The intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took over it last week.
It is not yet known when the aircraft will be physically dispatched from Vodokhody, according to Jan Pejšek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense.
In turn, the single-seater L-159 fighter aircraft were discarded from long-term-storage aircraft, without any further deposits or investment from the ministry's portfolio.
& quot; The twin-seated L-159T1 has been replaced in its current state and appearance & quot;, Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the Army will not have to do without two-seat combat aircraft since the Department of Defense signed a $200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 to convert four redundant L-159 aircraft into a two-seat version.
One new aircraft took over the army in July, the second plans to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to force the combat aircraft into equipping one of NATO's countries.
& quot; The Treaty makes clear that EADS is the purchaser of L-159 aircraft, and that they are intended to be used to train NATO pilots.
& quot; It is therefore up to the recipient as to how he realizes the thing, & quot; said Pejšek.
The Business Newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The bartering of five L-159s for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion kronor had been approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not put out out to tender at the time, but addressed EADS directly.
The then Defense Department argued this swap would support the future export of the L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines out of which it uses only 24. The rest it wanted to sell.
Incidentally, the purchase of the Casa aircraft is also likely to have a court replay.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice. The reason is that it had to choose the aircraft based on a whole European call for tender and not by a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three planes, the last of which is due to land at Kbely Airport in a fortnight's time.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of getting cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of getting prostate cancer.
That is the surprising finding of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be related to levels of the male hormone testosterone.
& quot; Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, especially in men up to sixty, & quot; said study co-author Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic or other risk factors are present, such as family health stresses, Ms. Eeles added.
Between 1994 and 2009, she and her colleagues in Britain tracked more than 1,500 patients suffering from prostate cancer, but also 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
In more than half of the study's participants, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was found as for 19 percent of men whose ring and index fingers were the same length.
However, for men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, and for men up to the age of sixty it decreased by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which form as early as prenatal age, evidently reflects the different levels of sex hormones the child was exposed to in the uterus.
Less testosterone equals a longer index finger.
Previous research found that it is precisely the testosterone that accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chairman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was vaguely aware of this study, yet he considers that the relationship between finger length and cancer risk has not yet been fully established.
Czech Republic in Snow - D1 and D5 closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
Snow is mostly stationary on the roads and sidewalks. Winter service workers have been on the road in many places throughout the entire night.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some lorry and car accidents. The D1 motorway at Brno towards Prague is also closed.
This said Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91 one truck crashed. At kilometer 93 two trucks collided. At kilometer 91 there are casualties.
There are also a few cars in the ditch.
Problems also occur at km 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks collided here as well.
Drivers should leave immediately after Brno at km 190 or drive through Brno and drive at km 182 at the village of Kývalka.
This is where kilometres of traffic jams form.
There has also been an accident on the D11, just off the approach to Prague.
In Prague itself, there is a blanket of snow several centimetres thick, and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees centigrade.
Car columns form, for example, in the Prosek part of the city. The Štěrboholská Street is also completely clogged up.
The safest mode of transport here is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
Prague Crisis Squad meets at eight o 'clock in the morning.
There are also problems with the railways and the airfield.
The Czech State Railways was forced to cancel seven express services due to drifting snow.
There are problems on the Prague-Kralupy line, for example, or Prague-Beroun.
Travellers should absolutely check out the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed from 11 o 'clock at night until 5 o' clock in the morning since Wednesday.
Most roads in Southern Moravia are only accessible with increased caution.
Three secondary roads are completely impassable around Vyškov. There are snow drifts in places around Brno. In the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow blowers on some higher level roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There, three streets are still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Again, you 'll need to use snow blowers to clear the snow.
It is not yet possible to predict when they will become passable again.
In the Hodonín region, caution is advised in the White Carpathian region.
The roads, which, for conservation reasons, can only be spread with inert gritters, have a blanket of snow up to five centimetres thick, said ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, new snow fell from two to ten centimetres, most of it in Northern Bohemia - up to 18 centimetres in places.
Up to 15 centimetres of fresh snow fell in the Moravian-Silesian Region.
However, it is slowly snowing in the Czech Republic.
American soldiers have a new & quot; smart weapon & quot;.
American troops have deployed a new & quot; smart & quot; weapon in Afghanistan for the first time. So far, it is only known by its code name, XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and shift the correlation of forces in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
In fact, your projectiles are directed to the target by laser with a precision of only a few metres.
The special 25 mm caliber bullets, designed for this rifle, and containing high explosive explosive material, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode at any point along their ballistic trajectory, not just when hitting the target.
This means you can use it against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in a trench.
From above, it is usually not protected, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily disable it.
According to Richard Audett, who helped develop the XM-25, the new assault rifle is the first infantry weapon to make use of & quot; smart & quot; technologies.
& quot; The soldier proceeds basically like this: he sights the target and sends out a laser beam which determines the distance, then he gains an accurate sight point after which he corrects the increase angle, then he only has to pull the trigger.
& quot; Let's say you measured 543 meters. & quot;
& quot; When you press the button, the weapon charges up and fires the projectile at the distance 543 yards plus minus one, two or three yards.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu Group relocates its Bad Homburg office to Frankfurt.
In July of next year 400 employees will move their workplace from the existing office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park.
Fujitsu, the Japanese group, is relocating its Bad Homburg office to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specialises in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday, in July next year 400 men and women will move their workplace from the existing office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large office complex located on Lyoner Strasse in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the company should be accommodated there. So far, they are spread out across the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive. Furthermore, the open-plan offices in the Astro Park better accommodate the way the employees work.
Fujitsu had also only been a tenant in Bad Homburg.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, & quot; with Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central location with excellent infrastructure.
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance, especially for a global company like Fujitsu.
The relocation of a major company within the region yesterday caused joy for the winners and disappointment for the losers.
The Frankfurter Wirtschaftsdezernent Markus Frank (CDU) said that this was another win for a & quot; global player.
This is a & quot; great location creed & quot;.
Fujitsu passe to the city, the settlement was an important impulse for Niederrad.
Bad Homburg Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed of the intention by management early on.
& quot; We have, of course, offered our help to the company & quot;, said Korwisi.
Friendship contacts, however, could not have altered the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the landlord of the property on Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been the decisive factor.
Now the point is to prevent a long empty space in such a prominent location.
& quot; I hope the owner and landlord of the building is being cooperative. & quot;
The Town Hall building used by Fujitsu so far, together with the adjacent Small Vertical building, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz, were among the city's most controversial construction projects ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city tree was created between the station and the city hall. It attracted criticism both because of the massive development of the areas that had previously been used as parking lots and because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software maker for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, then still associated with Siemens, moved into the company.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired by Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006, and resold a year later to Spain's Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Tokyo-based Fujitsu Konuzer describes itself as the world's third largest IT provider.
It provides companies, for example, computers and servers, and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany. However, Fujitsu has many more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions moves into Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
Among others, the headquarters of the Central Association of the Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry is located in the twenty-year-old complex - its name refers to its star-shaped floor plan.
Amazon Locks Server - Threats Assange
Wikileaks is coming under increasing pressure.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the Reveal platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind the release of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is said to be in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
Prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and corporations to boycott Wikileaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's wanted list, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
& quot; Wikileaks displaced from Amazon server. & quot;
& quot; Free speech in the land of free & quot;, the unveiling activists shared via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic cables to cope with the high number of access to the documents.
Per Twitter, Wikileaks explained about the step ahead: & quot; Great - our dollars are now being spent on keeping people busy in Europe. & quot;
If Amazon has such a problem with free speech, & quot; should stop selling books & quot;.
Amazon stopped using its servers through Wikileaks after staff members working for Senator Joe Lieberman made inquiries, CNN television, citing Lieberman's office, reported.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security committee had threatened to boycott Amazon, the British & qot; Guardian reported.
& quot; I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier given the prior releases of classified information by Wikileaks & quot;, said the senator.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be banned from being used on servers in other countries as well.
& quot; Wikileaks & apos; illegal, outrageous, and reckless operation puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the world, & quot; says in a nonpartisan senator's statement.
& quot; No responsible company - American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, wanted by Swedish authorities for rape, is on Interpol's wanted list of suspects.
According to a report in London newspaper & quot; The Independent & quot;, the 39-year-old Australian is in the UK. The exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always called the investigations in Sweden the intrigue of his opponents.
In London, Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there had been threats.
& quot; There were even calls for the assassination of Julian Assange. & quot;
That is why Assange is right to fear for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, requested that the person responsible for the Wikileaks revelations be prosecuted for treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper said - obviously ironically - on television that Assange should be killed & quot; and Obama could use & quot; a drone.
Meanwhile, a brawl broke out between the White House and Assange.
President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called & quot; ridiculous and absurd. & quot; had called for Assange to resign Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in case she was responsible for recently-revealed espionage calls made to diplomats.
& quot; I am not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a webpage, & quot; says Gibbs.
& quot; Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its one web site. & quot;
The American government is now putting the protection of its databases comprehensively to the test.
Russell Travers, the deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Operations, has been appointed as the special representative, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing necessary quot; structural reforms & quot; had become necessary after Wikileaks had disclosed the embassy reports.
The White House also wants to have the ways the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that it would provide security for dissidents and activists if they were threatened by the WikiLeaks publication.
& quot; We have done everything possible to get & quot; in touch with them, said Foreign Office spokesman Philip Crowley.
& quot; We stand ready to protect them if the need arises. & quot;
The Ice University
At & quot; Gelato University & quot; near Bologna, ice-cream makers are trained to prepare for better seasons.
The three-day Basic Course for Future Gelatieri has the most traffic and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice actually come from?
Of Gelatiere and Gelataio.
The gelatiere, which in German is somewhat old-fashioned as an ice-cream maker, makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian ice-cream-maker's art.
The Gelataio uses a spatula to fetch the ice-cream from the cooling box, then spreads it in the waffle, and then sells it.
You don 't need to go to Anzola dell' & apos; Emilia in the province of Bologna to know that.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can 't miss the & quot; Gelato University & quot; by Italian firm Carpigiani.
The Ice Cream University has set up the manufacturer of ice cream machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from his machines will live up to the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day Basic Course for Future Gelatieri attracts the most visitors and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day chocolate ice cream themed classes and internships at the in-house ice cream parlour.
Some people are dreaming of a new career in the midlife crisis; others are just venturing out on the smooth ice of their vague desires.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a quality European product in the future in the land of industrial Ice-Cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant. After years in a nerve-wracking job she wants to bag something of her own.
Two young Egyptian women dreaming of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice-cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia is coming because her children love Italian ice-cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants first.
What is crucial is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and good consistency.
Luciano does n 't forget the icing on the cake of the national and generally southern superstructure in his training: & quot; Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then there is a lot of romance involved. & quot;
The first step to making it seems quite straightforward.
Luciano tips the basic ingredients of milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that uses an electronic program to heat everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cool down to four degrees.
Then it turns up a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurised white base cream, basis for all milk ice-creams.
Immediately the lecturer is stormed with questions: Can you make ice cream only with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to your experimentation?
Luciano warns against letting the zeitgeist mislead you.
Anyone who speaks of ice-cream & quot; only made from natural & quot; ingredients may have used stabilizers anyway - usually a natural product, such as guar gum made from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice without a stabilizer, but you just have to sell it within a day. Otherwise, it will collapse and the customer will bite on nothing but grains of ice.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
It gets more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice-cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients purchased in the fruit section or in the supermarket sweets.
There are also powders and pastes.
& quot; The vendors will all try to turn dozens of flavored additives on you. & quot;
& quot; But you should just experiment. & quot;
Either with the fruit orbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or in the case of the ice-cream made from the white basic mass, which turns into a yellow form of cream with eggs, and the base for all possible chocolate temptations, with the help of cocoa powder.
Now the students are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano lets you make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice creams each - with or without eggs in the baseband, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavors, more fruit puree - that's not necessarily better in taste.
Hazelnut Ice Cream does n 't necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice cream is made by the Working Group, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced blend will really lift the flavor of a gelato, Luciano says.
Ice cream making is a math task: if peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content in the basic recipe has to be decreased.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is needed.
Luciano pulls out a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers measure thereby the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables ease the calculation.
Making ice no longer requires as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic preparation of the baseband helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice-cream mixture is simultaneously beaten creamy and chilled to sub-zero temperatures.
Despite all the automation, small glitches do n 't happen.
Brazilian Gustavo is mottling fruit puree on himself and his fellow students from top to bottom, when the oversized staff mixer gets out of control.
& quot; In any course & quot;, says Maestro Luciano, & quot; is only a matter of time until something like this happens. & quot;
Checkers Twilight
The European Food Safety Authority Efsa was undermined by the industry experimenting with GM plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which considers itself to be an independent institute for biotechnology impact assessment.
& quot; It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have documented & quot; well, said Testbiotech chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been contracted to the Ilsi lobbyists association for years.
The is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper was instrumental in the Efsa testing of genetically modified crops, and he had a clear conflict of interest, criticized Then.
The Efsa rules are paragraphs equal to position papers of the Ilsi, and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is supposed to be controlled by the authority in Parma, Italy.
It's the second time Testbiotech has faulted a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-level Efsa manager recently joined Syngenta, a Swiss agricultural company, without any conditions or transition period - and switched pages as a result.
The Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) radio station also recently revealed personal connections between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby. This has made the Federal Environment Agency, as well as MEPs, very keen.
However, the Efsa cannot detect a conflict of interest.
One resorts to all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, it is said in an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa are not required to have no contacts to the industry.
However, you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - for, among others, risk assessment for biotechnology without a mandate to lobby.
In the matter, independent experts like Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any feeding attempt on animals and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
& quot; We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn does on the field, & quot; says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant. This does not provide reliable results.
& quot; If you do n 't search for the risks, how can you find them? & quot;, asks Then accusingly.
This is also the view of Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientist has been doing research in genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich University of Technology.
The industry in this field, as in the USA, is now also trying more and more in Europe to influence or discredit critical scientists.
As a result, there are hardly any researchers left that are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies would usually not be published.
& quot; The industry controls & quot; security research, claims Hilbeck.
The bricks trace
Uli Gsell also got some, about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening he was standing in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is known: by September the dredgers had moved in and had begun to break off a large chunk of the north wing.
The Stuttgarter Welt was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the multi-billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When construction was stopped, much of the wing was in pieces.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft rough stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He has secured a few of the chunks.
& quot; These stones are relics. & quot;
& quot; You must not disappear.
He raves about it: & quot; A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy. & quot;
When he saw one, it smelled of cigarette smoke.
He does not know yet what he will do with the chunks.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The Stuttgart Stones trail leads to a forest near Tübingen, a former munitions depot for the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is trading old checkers.
He bought all of those that fell upon demolition in Stuttgart.
& quot; It would be a shame if they were grinding to gravel or disappearing into the landfill. & quot; says & quot; in its office, a wooden bunker that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when it was reported in the newspapers in September that he bought the remnants of the North Wing from the demolition contractor.
But he was talking to the S-21 opponents, for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for demolition after all.
And if it happens, then surely the most sensible thing to do is to continue to use the stones.
Some 200 opponents of the S-21 then took one of the cuboids, which weigh an average of 80 kilos, at a price of 6.50 to 14 euros apiece.
As a souvenir, but some too, in the hope of being able to give it back when it is rebuilt.
Rongen had purchased 500 tons, 25 large truck loads.
About half of it is still stored in the forest, the rest has already been sold.
Garden Owner, Landscape Gardener, House Builder.
From everywhere they came and dragged away what trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart Stones of Anstumes have long since been transformed into & quot; Mäuerle & quot; or the boundaries of herbal beds.
& quot; Actually, this stone is nothing special & quot; says Rongen.
& quot; Would Not be the Policy Component. & quot;
He climbs into his SUV, taking a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then became interested in computers and finally became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40,000 tons of bricks.
From all over Germany he is carting his treasures.
He says he is the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He is slowing down.
Artistically hewn sandstones lie in the snow.
& quot; You once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke & quot;, he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
& quot; My favorite stone. & quot;
It goes up the path through the forest.
It points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
& quot; Beautiful Travertine. & quot;
Once, the cubos belonged to the stand of Stuttgart's Neckar stadium.
All over the snow there are stones and stories, Cannstatter travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the St. Blasien cathedral, tuff from the Heilbronner Krankenhaus.
What work, what toil, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones were formerly hewn by hand and moved using simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awesome.
& quot; It would be scandalous to shred something like that. & quot;
He has not become rich, not to mention rock-rich.
But 14 people the stone dealer employs today, besides up in the forest have settled stonemason, a sculptor, a smith, a glassblower and a gardener.
& quot; We work hard, but it's satisfying & quot; says the remainder processor.
Soon he must go to Cologne.
There are bricks to save there too.
Talent battle for high-potentials
There is a bustling crowd at the buffet.
16 students crowded around salmon sandwiches, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they are asked to talk to VW developers about the car of the future - and get to know Volkswagen at the same time.
In the battle for the brightest minds, many companies now go into the melee, betting, like VW, on cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early in the lecture halls as possible, before they get into the job market and are courted by others.
And because universities do not issue statements about their students' performance, attempts are made to spot and bind the exceptional talents in practice projects.
On the second day of the workshop at TU Braunschweig, the car manufacturer is courting the talents.
A young lady from the personnel department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with the VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internships and student jobs and shows them ways into the corporation.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunschweig supervises the project with VW.
He sees the advantages for both sides: students get in touch with the industry and gain experience.
& quot; VW can simultaneously get to know students, look closer at interesting candidates, and consider who would be an appropriate employee. & quot;
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not unusual.
What is new is that there is so much aggressively bidding for the students.
& quot; otherwise, the focus was more on the technical project & quot;, says Selle.
The battle for the newly minted graduates is likely to become even harder.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large pool of applicants.
Instead, they have to bid themselves up, and especially courtship around highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
More than 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October, according to the Association of German Engineering VDI.
And the so-called Engineer Gap will be even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
Roman Dykta is hunting for talent at the audit and consulting firm KPMG.
He organises elaborate recruiting events, such as the KPMG Race, a kind of modern treasure hunt where participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students the company intends to send across the USA in the next year.
As an aside, attendees can view KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Whoever is allowed to with wins two rounds of preliminary selection.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants is flying to the USA.
When hewing and stabbing for the high potentials at the universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
& quot; We want to stand out from the crowd with the race. & quot;
& quot; Only one simple sailing trip was not enough for us. & quot;
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be on.
& quot; We are still in contact with all participants of a similar action in the last year. & quot;
& quot; Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon & quot;, he says.
In addition to direct booing at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular go on the classic at trade fairs.
& quot; We try to reach graduates at trade shows. & quot;
& quot; About at the Intersolar & quot;, reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows about the up-and-coming problems.
Currently, 35 posts are advertised on the company's website.
& quot; It's very hard to fill vacancies right now. & quot;
& quot; This costs a lot of time and money & quot;, she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
& quot; The professors give hints that you can do internships or write your thesis. & quot;
Expensive promotions are not announced at the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to advertise itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies, and easy communication.
& quot; This is often not what a large company can offer & quot;, says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the leading role in job hunting.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good career opportunities are other key factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The institute compiles an annual list of the best paid jobs in Germany.
To do this it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
HR Manager Stübe hopes the placement will also score plus points with job seekers.
& quot; I think that applicants especially look for external reviews about a potential employer & quot;, she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that means, according to Kriegler, mostly internal measures.
& quot; The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is to use & quot; on your own employees, he says.
In industry jargon, this means internal employer branding.
& quot; Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors. & quot;
If you treat your people well, and they identify with the company, then they would automatically advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances.
& quot; This is like playing with gang & quot; says Kriegler.
Obama to halt new oil drilling
Off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico there will be no new oil drilling operations in the coming years.
An appropriate ban has been issued by the Washington government - thus reversing its earlier plans for good.
Also off the Atlantic coast new drilling is prohibited for now.
This was announced by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to be in force for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the & quot; Deepwater Horizon rig in April.
Before the disaster that killed eleven workers and led to the largest ecological disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents thereby aim to reduce the USA's dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Whois responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been fully resolved.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy company BP. It is confronted with claims worth billions.
An investigation commission on Obama's behalf is scheduled to present its findings during the course of December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar had lifted the drilling ban imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter checks and stricter security, Obama and Salazar want to preclude another disaster.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which was discredited after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced to close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the output in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been up to now because of stricter regulation.
& quot; Government plans are the biggest drag on oil and gas industry growth, according to a recent industry survey by consultancy BDO - ahead of Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: no one knows what exactly will change with regulation. & quot;
Investment in new funding projects would be deferred until further notice, at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is Burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown. It smells like at a petrol station: billions of litres of spilled crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
& quot; Don 't plagiarize & quot;, the eco-activist is reassuring the journalists: & quot; You' ll still get enough oil mud in front of the lens today. & quot;
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to photograph a boy wading to his chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him. The scene is almost pretty in the rainbow-colored water gloss.
There is no sign of brown crude oil billowing beneath the surface.
She used to collect buckets of shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the inertial flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, huge quantities of crude oil were poured into the vast wetlands from a burst pipe.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-rich waters. Located in the heart of the Niger Delta, Ogoniland is considered to be one of the worst-polluted regions in the world.
As you travel through the mangrove swamps traversed by rivers, the full extent of devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of light-coloured water, the motor boat rumbles up brown broth. Whoever dips his hand in the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude from the floor like black liquorice sticks. Sadly, the occasional palm tree leaves their fronds hanging.
Swarms of birds, the kind usually found in wetlands, are sought in vain: as soon as the outboarder is silent, ghostly silence spreads through the former paradise that smells like a petrol station.
& quot; What is happening here is ecological warfare & quot;, says Celestine Akpobari sinister: & quot; We are living in perpetual danger to health. & quot;
The war comparison is appropriate.
The Ogoni settlement is a battlefield that has been fought over for decades: it was here that the first explorers from Europe invaded, more than 60 years ago; it was here during the 1980s that the first resistance was organized, with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, who was later executed. It was here that Shell had to stop production in 1993 because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is not allowed to return to Ogoniland. While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of Switzerland, three times the size of Switzerland, with over 5,000 drilling wells and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oilfields in Ogoniland are lying fallow, too unstable is the situation for the company.
Every few hundred meters, steel racks protrude like bizarre sculptures out of the water. & quot; Christmas trees & quot; are called the borehole heads way too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the marrow.
Again and again, such a drilling head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil trickles into the water.
More than two billion liters, according to expert estimates, have flowed into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: the amount of oil, as it penetrated into the sea off Alaska every year, as it did in the wreck of the super tanker & quot; Valdez; 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Whoever is to blame for the persistent eco-meltdown is disputed.
While Shell blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists see bursting well heads and leaking pipelines as the main causers.
Shell applies considerably lower security standards in Nigeria than would otherwise be the case in the world, US scientist Richard Steiner accused the corporation in 2008. The rate of pipeline defects alone is & quot; many times higher than elsewhere in & quot;.
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-smeared open-air workshop from a distance, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are splinter-naked and oil-smeared to the neck.
A fire is flickering beneath one of the many barrels, which can be seen partially connected to tubes, partially arbitrarily dispersed on the premises. A small underground refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil above the fire is heated for several hours, explains Michael, the group boss.
First gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot. Later, at the end of the pipe, kerosene and finally diesel trickle out.
For example, Michael and four people produce up to four barrels of diesel a day of 300 liters: & quot; That brings us 34,000 naira a & quot; - roughly 22 dollars.
Delta dwellers take advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal coaters can still beat the ridiculously low price of diesel, at just under 40 euro cents per litre. They get their raw material for free.
It comes from & quot; bunkers that tap into the pipeline network across Ogoniland. This way, according to experts, the country is losing at least 16 million litres of crude oil per day in the entire Niger Delta.
However, only a tiny fraction of the provisionally intermediate raw material is illegally refined: organized criminal networks, which are said to include politicians and high-level military men, fill the lion's share into tankers and give it away on the world market.
The debate over whether the environmental disaster is more due to the hustle and bustle of the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic, according to activist Akpobari.
& quot; If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders, and if they were not so thoroughly destroying fishermen's livelihood, there would be no sabotage, no theft, and no illegal refineries. & quot;
In the meantime, the Ogoni's relationship to Shell is so broken that only a deduction of the corporation could be considered: & quot; Maybe other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better. & quot;
Michael is getting nervous.
& quot; High time that you disappear & quot;, says the muscular oilman.
& quot; Every minute the soldiers can come.
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they will not be threatened with arrest, but they will have to pay a painful bribe.
Soldiers, mostly from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, also want to benefit from the raw material.
& quot; This damn stuff got our country on the dog in every way, & quot; says Akpobari.
Investigators discover dangerous build error in A380 engines
The A380 appears to have a major safety problem.
Investigators investigating an emergency landing of an aircraft have discovered a possible construction failure, which could lead to a & quot; catastrophic engine failure & quot;.
Qantas is now suing the engine manufacturer.
Passengers of the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing at the beginning of November appear to have had a lot more luck than previously known: the Australian Air Safety Authority has found a major safety problem with the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigation - and is now warning of a possible construction failure.
The potential defect would have severe consequences. With an oil hose joint, it could create fatigue cracks and leaks, said an ATSB agency statement released Thursday.
This could have led to & quot; a catastrophic engine failure.
Rolls-Royce engines in 20 A380 aircraft would be affected.
Below is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It filed a statement of claim in an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, allowing it to pursue further legal action against the company.
Qantas boss Alan Joyce said his airline would seek damages for the incident in early November.
Parts had come loose and the wings were damaged when the engine was engulfed.
Rolls-Royce blamed an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
Up to 40 engines need to be replaced worldwide now after the incident.
The Australian investigators announced to do further safety testing on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The security issue was deemed sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the Qantas plane made an emergency landing, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa changed engines on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker plane is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National Snowfall Triggers Traffic Chaos
Germany in white: Snow fell overnight across most of the country.
There is chaos on many roads, with trains and flights cancelled.
At least three people died in car accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany. In freezing temperatures, almost the entire Republic is covered with snow by night until Thursday - causing traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there are some 15 centimeter thick blankets of snow.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
Winter service was in continuous action on the A7 near Flensburg, but it was unable to cope with the snow that was constantly blowing up.
In addition, heavy gusts swept across the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Maritime Shipping and Hydrography Office (BSH) expects to see storm surges 1.2 metres above normal by mid-morning along the Schleswig-Holstein Baltic Sea coast.
In Saxony, drifting snow caused significant problems on the highways and highways.
Therefore, according to the meteorological center Meteomedia, an alarm level violet was announced - the highest level ever - in Saxon Switzerland.
In parts, 30 inches of fresh snow fell there, with fresh and strong winds bringing drifts.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there overnight.
In Saxony-Anhalt too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the roads.
On the A2, snow and wind caused traffic to stop and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the snowfall affected the A4 and A9 highways.
There are major disruption in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria, according to German Railways.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails, or destroyed overhead wires and switches are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train bound for Munich had to stop its journey.
The 165 passengers were provided with woolen blankets, food and beverages in the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds blew across the roads.
On major German airports, the snow winds result in numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman at the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been canceled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
The winter service is in continuous use.
Although there are only a few stranded passengers at the airport, there are still nearly 400 camp beds available for them.
There were already accidents on many streets on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed when he collided with a train at a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The engine driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snow-covered roads. Here again a lorry was detected on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the early hours of the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after falling over her car on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg.
However, meteorologists do have some good news: the snow will still be loose and powdery, and will therefore start to swirl up even in light gusts.
But the wind will slow down.
Only the Baltic Sea is battered by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - down to minus 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank seeks a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its landmark: according to a newspaper report, Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could fetch up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its headquarters pretty: the twin towers in Frankfurt's banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, bankers have been allowed to return to their old jobs.
But now the finance company apparently wants to recoup the cost of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, as the & quot; Financial Times Deutschland & quot; writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
& quot; We always check if it makes more sense to own or sell property ourselves and then rent back & quot; afterwards, he said.
This means that Germany's largest credit institute will relinquish its head office after a short period of time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund as late as the middle of 2007, and then extensively renovated them afterwards.
The energetic conversion devoured approximately 200 million euro according to the data.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed to & quot; Greentowers, is around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper.
Whether the buildings will be resold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead buddy
More than 10,000 people have commemorated buried miners in New Zealand who have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
Still, the bodies could not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft continues to be precarious.
About two weeks ago, there was a violent explosion at the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners aged between 17 and 62 years old were buried underground.
A probe had been lowered into the accident shaft, but had not detected any trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue personnel could descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no chance of survival for the buddies anymore.
The bodies could not be retrieved yet.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth, New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up, showing helmets, lamps, and the names of the buddies.
Also pictures and personal objects, among them pieces of clothing and surfboards, found their place here.
Flags flew at half-mast in front of the country's government buildings.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would bring & quot; back to the surface from the depths of the earth, New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told those attending the commemoration.
& quot; But they never came home. & quot;
He could not finish with the death of his son until he saw his corpse, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats participated in the commemoration.
Miners of British and South African descent were also buried in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases are displaced, they will begin to cool down the blazing temperatures inside the mine, Police Chief Gary Knowles told reporters.
To Hell, Warrior!
Does Splatter match Art Cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries anew with his fighter epic, & quot; Valhalla Rising.
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have in mind when he filmed & quot; Walhalla Rising & quot;?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and uses near superhuman forces to kill his enemies in rows - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero enjoys using rabid killing methods and tearing his enemies' intestines out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as it is actually called, says no word about the whole movie, and even the other characters let themselves be carried away to at most one or two sentences or a few agonizing cries of death.
Otherwise you will be silenced and revelled in the creepily beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland that provides the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal more for adult cineastes with an interest in existentialism and very quiet tracking shots.
Nice when a movie has multiple audiences; shame only when they are mutually exclusive.
Director Winding Refn has been regarded as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and stylised drug dealer trilogy, & quot; pusher & quot;, but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or, or a little less brutality, to the Arthouse.
Most art cinema fans will probably be put off by the squirting brain mass and the intestines.
The action fans die at the latest then from boredom, when for freely interpretable reasons one-eyed with a troop of violent Christian missionaries leaves via ship to Jerusalem and an eternity is stuck in the doldrums and fog, before the team apparently arrives in America and remains silent there.
No wonder then that & quot; Walhalla Rising & quot; did not find a cinema distributor in Germany. It has now only appeared on DVD.
This is especially a whiner because of the magnificent images, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping façade hides a sometimes-exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This movie is not about dialogs or a stringent plot. It's all about atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And from that there is no escape for the viewer.
Refn barely begrudges him a moment of relaxation. With his icy images and the sinister Trance-like soundtrack, Refn slowly closes his throat, but especially with the incredible hatred that beats against him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blond boy, faithfully standing by One-Eye, preserves something like innocence. All the others are driven by anger.
Most of all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who, for enemies and temporarily allies, eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly the messenger of the devil himself.
It means spoiling, but maybe only for the already spoiled.
& quot; Walhalla Rising. & quot; is an enigmatic movie you can hate and admire, for annoyance, excitement and amazement.
An experience.
Enigmatic Ground Work
The Atomic Energy Agency IAEA has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country refuses to adopt a position on this - nor does it allow controls.
Around midnight from September 5 to September 6, 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attack a mysterious, cube-like building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria, with the help of North Korea, allegedly built into the cuboid, hidden away in a valley draining away from the stream.
According to a briefing by the US Foreign Intelligence Service (CIA) at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby town of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
By contrast, technology from the fifties is hardly useful for other purposes.
The CIA performed a video presentation with unsharp satellite images.
Using a computer animation, it faded in where what components of the reactor are said to have been before destruction, which is a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
She also provided photos showing the building up close, or even the interior.
The reactor was about to be commissioned, it was said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, is little more known than then, yes the puzzles got rather bigger with the time.
In a recent memoir, former US President George W. Bush revealed that while the CIA was fairly certain that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, it saw little evidence that there was a & quot; active nuclear weapons program in the country.
Some intelligence professionals in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and speak only of a & quot; alleged reactor, even if they think the CIA presentation is plausible & quot;.
You lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was of having a reactor in front of him, a senior UN diplomat replied only succinctly in the summer that the IAEA had enough material to ask & quot; questions.
The rubble from the alleged & quot; unused military building, & quot;, was hurriedly cleared away by the Syrians, and the terrain was thoroughly leveled.
Nevertheless, in June 2008 an IAEA team, led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen, found human-made traces of uranium in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received, via a member state, satellite images of commercial suppliers from the period immediately after the attack, which are probably more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - purchased them exclusively.
Thus, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always maintained that it has never run a clandestine nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as improbable after analysing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as about the satellite images.
Moreover, it denies the controllers a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
But Israel, too, is ironically silent.
& quot; We will never comment on the & quot;, 'Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, acting at the time of the attack, reiterated the official position recently.
Thus, since June 2008, the investigation of the case has dragged on without result, and & quot; is increasingly becoming a serious credibility problem for the agency, & quot;, as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA's headquarters in Vienna admitted - after all, there is a serious violation of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA guards.
The key to reconnaissance progress, the IAEA apparently sees three more facilities, which are supposed to have a functional connection between & quot; and the presumed reactor - and, unlike this one, it still exists.
In doing so, the inspectors have not yet disclosed which facilities they are dealing with, nor what function they have, or what makes them appear suspect.
According to the information provided by the IAEA, they are internally referred to as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and used satellite imagery to locate a Masyaf building complex, which is most likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately beside a military base - it is precisely on this basis that Syria prevents the IAEA from accessing the three sites.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians fear a fishing expedition - that the IAEA is being sent by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip-off from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has evidence, including satellite photographs, that material was transported back and forth between the three locations and the cuboid at the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the plants could be & quot; related to the & quot; fuel production.
But there is no evidence of sensitive activity, he said, such as uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes needed to build a nuclear weapon.
The type of reactor, though, is powered by Uranium which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from, and where it was later used to separate the plutonium for the bomb, there are at best plausible conjectures about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether any debris that could contain valuable traces has been stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truck loads have disappeared from the ground, nobody wants information about where the debris has gone.
The al-Tibni Salt Mine, located just a few kilometers from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates River, which Syria examined in 1998 for its suitability as a radioactive waste storage site, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane & apos; s Intelligence Review.
However, footage from orbit shows that Syria conducted earthworks at the three suspect locations and removed large containers after the IAEA demanded access.
This may be coincidence, but it did little to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, it is said in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspection there, to allow Syria to preserve any military secrets - the sheer effort indicates just how much interest the inspectors have.
However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna only a year ago had appeased that the reactor had been destroyed, so the matter does not have a high level of urgency, for instance US ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing into play for a few months now so-called special inspections, one of the strictest means the Vienna atomic authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of & quot; an option to which I am open to & quot; in the future, but he is still hesitating.
There is a high risk in this path. For one thing, it requires a majority in the IAEA board of governors, and quite a few of the 35 countries represented there are far from eager for an escalation.
On the other, how to give a diplomat to consider: & quot; What if they find nothing at the end? & quot;
love in times of war
There has been trouble since Angelina Jolie started working on her as yet unnamed directorial debut in the summer.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don 't know much more about it - but that alone is enough for restlessness.
There is a persistent rumor that the woman, a Muslim woman, fell in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavia war.
Bosnian Women's Associations immediately protested, whereupon some days of filming planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile the film is finished in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Female Victims of War wrote to Jolie about the UNHCR, requesting a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself a UN refugee agency ambassador.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a few weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims tells you enough about the script.
Your organization has recommended, according to the UN Refugee Agency, dismissing Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, gave a shooting permit for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come anyway then.
The young author herself affirms that she does not pursue any political intentions with her film. She has worked very hard on the Yugoslavia conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all parties involved.
However, on the content it remains vague.
There is a second synopsis circulating on the Internet about the film, which sounds quite different: the lovers knew each other in it even before the outbreak of war. They meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim woman, is kidnapped to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
Which sounds a lot different from the version & quot; Rape Victim has a crush on Tortorknecht & quot;.
That Jolie's movie actually begins before the war - that' s for sure.
Pressing them, Jolie says, is unfair to & quot; and based on misinformation & quot;.
Now probably only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace now: by illegally putting the script online, as so many have done before.
Nothing Like Away
This evening is finally all-rounder for the Irish once again.
No trace of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much for that.
The fans howl with joy at crashing loud music, they stamp their feet.
The Bailey pub in Cork, southern Ireland trembles as players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance into beer cups - and hit them.
& quot; Beer Pong & quot; is called the Bizarre Spectacle. You can win 500 Euro plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the Beer Pong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; that shrill drinking game and the low-key computer scientist, don 't really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to enjoy himself, distracting himself from the nagging question of what the future will bring.
Not only is playing fun in Las Vegas on his schedule, he will be doing job interviews in New Zealand in January.
& quot; I have a queasy feeling doing & quot;, he says.
& quot; It's so far away from home and I still have no work there. & quot;
After all: his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - & quot; she had a crack, twitch her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign & quot;, says the young man, smiling.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney. His brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: It looks like the Tanners on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish are likely to leave the country anytime soon, experts at the ESRI economic and social research institute in Dublin predict.
By 2015, they predict 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there will be a wave of emigration comparable to that suffered by Ireland in the Eighties.
After a decade of upswing that brought great prosperity for the Irish, tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is unsettling especially the young, well-educated Irish, for whom there has been only uphill competition so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd during the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
Meanwhile, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without a job.
In the Irish Times there are loads of letters to the editor from young emigrants complaining: '& quot; Everything is going down the drain in Ireland'. & quot;
& quot; There should be a revolt against politicians and bankers - but who can, will go away and our country will lose an entire generation. & quot;
& quot; The last one to turn the light off, please. & quot;
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Students Union, sees a bleak future looming because the government is only window-dressing and no longer offers young people any future prospects.
& quot; They are reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy for creating new jobs & quot; says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students shimmy from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate herself for four years.
& quot; This idea is sad and depressing. & quot;
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to occupy the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes the & quot; WorkingAbroadExpo & quot;, an all-round service for working abroad.
& quot; For career starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first few steps on the career ladder, & quot; says the manager.
On its website photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
Seán O & apos; Donovan has known for half a year what it feels like to build something somewhere else.
Because there was nothing left for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on building in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are currently moving up a fashion house.
In January we go on to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
Nowadays, it is rare for O & apos; Donovan to see his home, because he does extra shifts to pay off the loan for his home.
& quot; The situation is already a bit crazy & quot;, he says, as he steps across the threshold of his house for the first time in a long time.
& quot; I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never any more. & quot;
He laughs a bit sheepishly and walks through cooled rooms.
The little house is situated in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens. Large, expensive cars park in the driveways.
Along with a sister, O & apos; Donovan bought the home four years ago for $380,000 -- 100 percent loan-financed.
& quot; There were crazy times, there was easy money with no many questions & quot;, he says.
Does he fear that it might go wrong with the loan?
O & apos; Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea after, and says: 'I have no kids to feed through and I am young; even when everything is going wrong, I can start over.'
The civil engineer does not like the wailing that he often hears these days.
& quot; No one has to starve - our situation is not nearly as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island & quot;, he says.
& quot; Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing to happen - maybe it makes us feel Irish. & quot;
He laughs, and then tells of his father who has gone to England during the last great economic crisis.
& quot; After seven years, he was back again and life continued in Ireland, quite simply. & quot;
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future open and let's see how it goes with life somewhere else.
He has already completed a few years of work in London, so why not a good start for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that really worries him these days: celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
He fears that it could degenerate into a goodbye party.
& quot; Just not too many emotions & quot;, he says, and takes a big sip of his beer.
& quot; Goodbye, that sounds scary. & quot;
& quot; Let's call it a walk-away party, easy going, with some friends, some drinks, some games. & quot;
The Demoatric routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is support for private enterprises.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These are the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been done regularly since 1995, thus showing the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts especially fall into & apus;'s eye in this year' s survey of September and October.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In numerous countries along the South American Pacific Coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been growing at an annual rate of 6% since 2002, the number of pro-democracy supporters increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
You can also see such a trend in Mexico, where the economy is recovering since last year's sharp drop.
But only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are staunch Democrats, lowering the regional average (see Chart 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents said they would be satisfied with their country's democratic practices. That' s as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Chart 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of your country and 45% trust their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase over 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined democracy efforts.
That this continued even during the Great Depression may have been because the countries of Latin America experienced only a brief period of recession, and recovered quickly.
Moreover, the poor have been absorbed by a stronger social safety net.
(According to reports from the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009, and has fallen again by 32% this year.)
However, there are strong mood differences from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread sense of progress.
This is less the case in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more acute and violent crime has increased.
For only the second time since the survey began, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% state that either they themselves or a family member became victims of a crime in the last year. But against 38% last year the values have decreased, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
Rising economic output is reflected in the stronger support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents nationwide said that private sector is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of a private sector), despite their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizing many private companies.
Brazil has the most weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
By contrast, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the US as the most influential country, with this role taken over by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An electioneater
No one had expected that the November 28th elections in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election workers who rushed to the stricken country's aid.
Overflowing ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, gutter ballot boxes, destroyed polling stations, and intimidation were just a part of the problems.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, many of them made homeless by the January earthquake, wandered around in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed front-runners, requested that the election results be revoked because of an alleged fraud.
Protests took place across the country, some of them violent.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the head of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election & quot; pretty good in many ways & quot;.
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community & quot;, these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate & quot; the process.
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, supposedly beholden to the unpopular outgoing president René Préval and his candidate Jude Célestin, will announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected runoff is scheduled for Jan.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity suit.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no support among voters, declares to be the winner of the runoff, the election could be in trouble.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On Election Day, many Haitians were prevented from voting because of a lack of organization.
Approximately 250,000 passes required for election purposes were not issued just before the election began.
The stakes are high.
Donor countries view a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secret to Center
In the weeks after your husband died, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy, driving her popularity rating up 20 points, to over 50% - the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, whether this will help her win re-election next year depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The characters for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who steered economic policy even after his wife was elected, often drew up budgetary plans that did not fully take into account tax receipts, economic growth, and inflation.
This allowed the presidential pair to spend the extra revenue as they saw fit.
On paper, last year the Fernández government lost a majority in Congress.
But the opposition is divided, and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27 October led to further divisions.
Some critics of the regime from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery), Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
& quot; I will not discuss & quot; on this, the president said.
The 2010 Budget now applies to the next year as well, which gives the President even more time to spend as she pleases.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by as much as 9% this year.
Official inflation currently stands at 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage claims from the unions - push it to close to 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and fighting poverty to be his main goals, not lowering inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullying the private sector, and purging the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently beautified the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now take a more moderate path?
It has called the private sector and union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases in the next year are to be limited to 18%.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given a strong boost to the economy.
But inflation undermined the growth spurt by a big devaluation in 2002.
It may be for this reason that Cristina Fernández wants to reconnect Argentina financially with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government reached an agreement with holders of securities that had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now, Fernández appears to be pushing for a deal with the creditors of the Paris Club, to whom she is owed approximately $6.7bn.
The Kirchners had always refused IMF verification, as is customary elsewhere.
But last month Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide technical assistance to & quot; in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known if Fernández will continue to be politically active after her term ends, even without the support of her husband.
If so, it will need middle-class support to do so. Most of them are fed up with Kirchnerism.
When the Argentinians return in March from their summer vacation, the wave of sympathy shown to them will be gone.
If she wants to win another election, she has to choose whether to silently reverse many of her husband's policy choices.
Glow of applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the strait
On November 27th, more than 7.5 million voters, or 70% of all eligible voters, set out to vote for mayors and city councillors in the five boroughs. This is counted as a broad evaluation of President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building ground-breaking business relationships, including a partial free-trade agreement, Ma himself has become a symbolic figure for relations with the mainland. His policies have transformed China's relationship with the mainland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the test, but only narrowly.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it received no majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), advocating greater independence for Taiwan, got nearly 50% of the vote, the KMT got 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant trouble for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of the vote has fallen by approximately 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the Councils together with the KMT.
During the election, there were the usual occurrences in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with riot-makers, flag-waving mass parades, and scantily-clad dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan and Honorary Chair of the KMT, gave a speech on the eve of the election on a KMT candidate,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander was killed.
More bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Separately, according to Tsai Ing-wen, leader of the DPP, the attack has affected the election and cast the DPP in a bad light, giving the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the campaign's biggest winner.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to highlight its relationship with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also avoided stoking anti-China sentiment too much.
It was responding to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
For Ma's part, he wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The Beijing government will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back to the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly wants political integration, too. But the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential elections.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago it was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his 2000-2008 presidency, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of moderate politicians emerged, and the DPP is fighting for the voices of professionals and the youth.
Tsai was widely approved as the DPP's presidential candidate, as Su Tseng-chang was under Chen.
Your party is now doing everything it can to demonstrate that it is also capable of building close ties with Beijing.
Tsai plans to create a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires non-prejudice discussions.
Tsai publicly declared that her party offers a & quot; trusted alternative to Ma's rash approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the DPP's candidates had done better at insisting on Taiwan' s independence.
He even told the pragmatist Su to abstain from the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's meddling, the DPP finds it hard to choose its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to conduct their campaign without him.
The main reasons for its unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan is only partially supportive of re-approximation.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, & quot; already has no turning back & quot;.
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded a place in the Newcomer of the Year category
When you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the 2009 Nobel Prize Ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her 2008 album, & quot; Esperanza & quot;, the nomination seems a little out of the ordinary. However, it is in keeping with Grammy rules, which require that an artist must not have released more than three albums before releasing the album he or she became known to the general public.
Her ambitious 2010 album, & quot; Chamber Music Society & quot;, is certainly a step forward. And with her buoyant voice and a good feel for pop, funk and Latin music, Spalding can easily be compared to Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category is the closest thing to Spalding's nomination.
Furthermore, the Vijay Iyer Trio's album, & quot; Historicity & quot;, was nominated in the Instrumental Album category. This critic' s favorite enjoyed huge success.
Iyer's competitors include & quot; Moody 4B & quot; by the experienced saxophonist James Moody and & quot; Positootly & quot; by keyboarder John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a raucous favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest on HBO's & quot; Treme & quot;, was recognized in the Contemporary Jazz category. This category usually features albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Societ of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category large group. He is thus competing against the Billy Childs Emsemble with its chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and its octet, whose Life-Ablum & quot; Pathways & quot; is a good example of a bass player as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the Classics categories
The Classical Nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
Top of the list is Michael Daugherty's & quot; Deux Ex Machina & quot; for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey' s & quot; Dreamhouse & quot;, an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California is the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his Symphony No. 4 & quot; Los Angeles & quot;. This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra and premiered at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A. based composer Avner Dorman has also been nominated for his mandolin concert.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, ranging from orchestral, opera, choir, to solo recordings.
In the classical producers category, five artists have been nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot; and & quot; Metropolis Symphony & quot; performed by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey & quot; Dreamhouse & quot; from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; & quot; Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati & quot; performed by various artists
In the opera category, Berg's & quot; Lulu was nominated by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Adolf Hasse' s Marc Antonio e Cleopatra & quot; by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos & quot; L & apos; Amour de Loin & quot; by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot; by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivans & quot; Ivanhoe &
As a composer, Pärt was nominated for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for & quot; Deus Ex Machina & quot;, Hans Werner Henze for & quot; Appassionatamente Plus & quot;, Magnus Lindberg for & quot; Graffiti & quot; and Shchedrin for & quot; The Enchanted Wanderer & quot; won a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was premiered and recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic on January 4th at Disney Hall, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is titled & quot; Los Angeles & quot; and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's & quot; Mondoline Concerto & quot; received a nomination in the Instrumental Solo with Orchestra category.
The L.A. composer stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
& quot; I have used Middle Eastern sounds and numerous North African sounds and rhythms, Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the Orchestral Performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
Pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster have been nominated as instrumental soloists.
As vocal soloists, only women were nominated this year. Among them are Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of & quot; Roots - My Life, My Song & quot;.
Temecula Mosque Wins Planning Committee Approval
Building a mosque in Temecula won the unanimous approval of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic jams.
However, according to a statement released by the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
& quot; The project is supported by many good people - Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many other & quot; people, said Hadi Nael, Chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
& quot; As an American, this makes me proud. & quot;
& quot; It shows that justice reigns. & quot;
& quot; There are few opponents to & quot;, he added.
& quot; They are just very noisy. & quot;
& quot; There are wonderful people living in this valley. & quot;
The session began at 18: 00 and the discussions for and against building the center took almost until midnight. The voices on both sides were fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
& quot; There is no more & quot;, said one commentator.
& quot; It is another planet of apes, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand. & quot;
& quot; America is at the end. & quot;
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam has called Mahmoud Harmoush for non-violence.
His community of about 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wished for a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented along with a water filtration equipment manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 Mediterranean-style mosque is to have two minarets and will be approximately 13 m tall.
It is to be constructed on the approximately 17,500 square feet of land on Nicolas Road, near Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still lodge an objection to the project with the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could provide new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien species of bacteria that can live off arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, they believe it is a sign that life is possible even without those elements previously thought to be vital.
& quot; This organism has two possibilities. & quot;
& quot; He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow. & quot;
& quot; This makes it something very special, though it is almost a kind of & apos; alien & apos; way of life, said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorous and sulphur.
However, as the scientists discovered, the bacterium continues to grow in California's Mono Lake even if it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
& quot; It makes you wonder what else & quot; can do, said the report's co-author, Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the quest for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognise life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details about the discovery were disclosed, gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery of & quot; shows that in other planetary systems, organisms, with the help of other elements, can set biochemical processes in motion, and that the & apos; standard elements & apos;, which we believe are absolutely vital, are not necessarily pre-determined & quot;, Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom explained.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
& quot; This work is a novelty because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another, & quot; added Cockell.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both could possibly replace one element with the other.
& quot; The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus. & quot;
& quot; This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other.
& quot; But the difference is so big that arsenic acts differently than phosphorus. It gets into our biochemical system where it smears virtually everything & quot; says Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
While the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can survive even in arsenic, showing that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, where arsenic is more abundant.
According to Jamie S. Foster, Lecturer in Microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced with arsenic is not a new one. But there has not yet been a working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, which is why science assumed that early life forms used it.
& quot; This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently from the early Earth-Age & quot;, says Forster. She was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health.
Remaining Stolen Show Dogs Found in Compton
The remaining two of the four show dogs stolen from outside a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff 'office.
The four exhibit dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unidentified persons stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which the animals were housed outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two were discovered Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
& quot; The good news is: the dogs are doing well & quot;, according to Whitmore.
& quot; You are in good condition. & quot;
& quot; They were returned to their rightful owners.
Whitmore gave no details about where the dogs were found or the circumstances that led to their discovery.
& quot; Investigations are still in progress.
& quot; We do n 't want to say any more about this, & quot;, explains Whitmore
& quot; We are tracking some tracks.
The dog's owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for comment on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a district bull shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs at different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were unhurt, according to authorities.
But the Bunny and Peter corgis, which Rickard and Peek were about to introduce to the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend for the AKC / Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was due to enter the contest.
As Peek told The Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other contests on the days before the AKC / Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly one-month tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night Peek and Rickard checked themselves in at the motel.
They often spend the night in motels, parking their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - with them to their motel room.
The thick-chested Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window open one slit wide, so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen at 6: 00 on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's salary to anyone who could give a hint about the corgis. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
As of Thursday, it was not yet known whether a finder's salary will be paid.
Lion roars again after MGM restructuring court approval
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the & quot; creditor plan to repay $5 billion in debt and pave the way for new movies and television shows at the 86-year-old entertainment company.
According to Thursday's testimony, the plan fulfills the requirements of US bankruptcy law, so nothing will stand in the way of MGM' s reboot under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat slimmed down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees will be reduced from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will, in fact, not take effect until after JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to fund the new MGM productions.
Currently, a consortium of the Investment Bank, itself raising $75 million, is leading the company. Financing is slated for mid-December.
Restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with an assignment to the Moelis & amp; Co investment bank to help management, struggling with $300 million / year of interest payments, resolve its financial problems.
In August, CEO Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & amp; Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM' s financial woes and pay out the studio's more than 140 creditors took longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided to put the company up for sale at the end of 2009.
But the auction attracted only a few bidders, and none wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything started all over again when the MGM team started with the restructuring plan. After months of discussions and internal disputes, it was finally signed by the creditors at the end of October.
If MGM has officially survived bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The stake for Moelis & amp; Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who were paid $375,000 per month for running the company, received a & quot; success bonus & quot; of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one movie, and drew up an annual schedule of seven or eight films, slated to hit theaters in early 2012.
They also plan to co-produce two films after & quot; The Little Hobbit.
The studio needs a separate $265 million to $275 million loan for its financial stake in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who funded about 18% of the MGM loan, tried to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the last negotiation between the two companies produced no result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget balanced
This year's favorite of the presents is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gadgets can rip a sizable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is equivalent to about 10 classic skipping ropes, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But you can conserve your gift budget.
Recently, searching for three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys & quot; R & quot; Us and a BJ & apos; s Wholesale Club.
It immediately became clear to me that Moore's Law had taken effect. This year, the technology games are more powerful, and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys with their own webpages appear, the most well-known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have a wider range.
More and more button-cell-powered toys are hitting the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some suggestions.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices of Toys & quot; R & quot; Us are.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children 3 years and older) are plush figures, the size of guinea pigs, that sing a note when pressed to their belly.
Pressing once corresponds to a note, pressing several times allows you to play a song.
Multiple sing-a-ma-jigs singing in harmony.
Warning: Once you have started pressing, you cannot stop.
For a combination of singing and dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, children 2 and older) is the best choice.
Based on Elmo's Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interchangeable play like & apos; Simon says & apos;, and thanks to the new hinged legs with wheel blocking, it masters the moon walk.
Children testing the device use Mickey as their dance teacher. However, their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you will certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning toys.
Now it's back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40, for children aged 3 and up), with a whole pile of question cards to turn a car ride into a lesson, with a better-known one with an autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not like to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. The games included on it are not, however, as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children 3 to 12). This comes with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major reworking of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassette tapes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children 3-7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and ebooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children 8 and older). The five blocks are no bigger than a match box, and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together to words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling contest.
More and more toys have some kind of on-line connection.
If you go alone after the range in the toy stores, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can purchase a Disney Club Penguin 2 & quot; Mix & apos; N Match Figure Pack ($5 for children ages 6-to-12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the Code Online, your child receives enough Credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
This can be rollerskates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head-cell-powered micro-robot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children aged 5 and up) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It is fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he endures quite a lot.
Ours fell off the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China are getting smoother
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin strode across a city square, checking on his nervous subordinates and, in doing so, issuing commands with military authority and a muted voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's rugged guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary raids and penchant for violence - to impress viewers.
& quot; Stand Just Up!
& quot; Look Straight! & quot;
& quot; Shows them & quot;, he whispered to them, & quot; like pretty girls are like that! & quot;
Four girls, barely past the teenage years, stood taut with white gloves and identical olive-green jackets and trousers.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight row.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue and white striped bows.
& quot; For me, they look average from & quot;, Mr. Tang observes dismissively.
& quot; Models are pretty.
Several governments have already tried to burnish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a college degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue instead of the gray-green uniform.
Wuhan in central China replaced violence with staring down. In 2009, according to reports, 50 officers circled a food truck not properly lined up, staring at the operator until, after half an hour, he packed up and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003 13 women reinforce the city police strips. They have been specially selected because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They are intended to give the rough-and-ready police a softer, feminine aspect.
But alas, even Scarlett Johansson would hardly be able to improve the bad image the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city laws with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
However, the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei Province beat to death a bystander as he filmed them using his mobile phone to film them beating down a protest against a dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a scuffle with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officers trained to attack street vendors in China.
& quot; Chengguan makes the government fear & quot;, the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper requested a & quot; really thorough purge & quot;.
Sceptics consider the current approach to be significantly insufficient.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News posed the question of whether the women had real jobs, or should just serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for with good physiques and & quot; harmonious features.
You should be above average tall - about 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1 / 2 inches.
The employment ends on reaching the age of 26.
According to the officials, the activity is too strenuous for women over 25.
& quot; The most important thing about & quot; is its image, & quot; said an unnamed district official at the quasi-governmental Web site Rednet. com.
& quot; Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their appearance, like height, weight, facial features, etc. & quot;
Then come temperament and & quot; inner qualities & quot;.
& quot; Female Chengguan are like flower vases & quot;, he said. He added, but in addition to that, they have other duties & quot;.
Zheng Lihua, deputy chief of the district administration, does not wish to agree with this description,
admitted, however, that it is not unusual for China to set sizes in job listings for both genders.
The same applies to even features.
Whether this equates to good looks is disputed in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disfigurements do not need to apply.
& quot; Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or humpbacks here. & quot; will do so, says Mr. Zheng.
& quot; Your Image Would Not Be Good.
Liu Yi, patrolling on the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She didn 't find it sexist that people put so much emphasis on their appearance.
& quot; Do you think I look sexy in this uniform? & quot; asks her with an ironic look on her face.
Your colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, commenting, & quot; We's job is to represent the image of the city.
According to them, they do n 't regret the short hiring, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply to scrub traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol is concerned with about twelve street vendors, trying to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or by bicycle, before being chased away.
& quot; Mr. Wang, please disappear here. & quot;
& quot; We have said this to you so many times! & quot; explains this to Miss Xu; to a trader who fled on foot, having temporarily abandoned his noodle kitchen, which was fixed on top of a bicycle cart.
According to the female officer, the activity is more monotonous than strenuous.
& quot; It's the same & quot; almost every day, says Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in her spare time.
& quot; Everything Routine. & quot;
One reason for this is that the female civil servants are not allowed to confiscate the merchants' goods, as their male colleagues are.
You can only threaten offenders to report them to their male supervisor.
This is to protect them from the public hostility that officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province, went on a rampage after rumor circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a trader.
More than a dozen police and Chengguan officers were injured in the nocturnal incident. 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has been spared from such violence hitherto.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officers were on patrol that morning, over 50 people gathered at one street corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle which was repaired contrary to regulations on the sidewalk instead of a workshop.
The owner was screaming Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, the grim-faced officers made their way to their vehicles and continued riding the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male patrol coordinator, stayed behind, flipping his white nameplate to remain anonymous.
Like their female colleagues, the co-ordinators - men over 40 - have a purely supporting role.
However, they have not been trained to present a clean image.
& quot; Sometimes we are verbal. & quot;
& quot; sometimes but also physically & quot;, explains Mr. Li matter-of-factly.
& quot; Most of the time people start arguing. & quot;
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of any charges brought against him following his affair with a former election aide and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision brings to an end the most serious legal case against Senator Ensign, the Nevada Republican. Until the scandal that made national headlines and dampened his career, he was considered as the possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was very pleased about the verdict after the year-long investigation & quot;.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers they have been informed by the Ministry of Justice that the investigation against Senator Ensign has been terminated and that there are no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The ruling was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department. They believe there was sufficient evidence to prove that Ensign violated the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails, and other documents, first disclosed in The New York Times in October 2009, led to speculation that Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his election aides, win lucrative contracts to buy his silence on an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as Ensign's treasurer during an election campaign.
Ensign contacted some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he lobbied for them after Hampton was hired.
As Hampton was recently on Ensign's election team, he was not allowed to do any lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the Affair, violated the so-called revolving-door lobbying ban.
According to the published circumstantial & quot; evidence, it appears to be a collusion and a violation of the revolving-door statutes, & quot; said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the sights of the government.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department seemed very cautious about taking up political charges after a variety of defeats that were pursued with great interest by the media, including last year's decision to drop charges against former Sen. Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the attorney general.
& quot; prosecutors are obviously terrible & quot;, said Melanie Sloan, chairwoman of the & quot; Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington. & quot; (an organization whose goal is to fight corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign in court.
& quot; This basically means that high level government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them & quot; added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's lead defense lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day, in which he was told that the department would not bring any charges against its client.
Mr. Ensign's defense lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors to convince them that, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, the senator had acted in accordance with the law.
Mr. Coggins declined to detail the legal arguments he had made to prosecutors.
& quot; I am not comfortable going into the talking details between the Ministry of Justice and myself. Only this much is said: we believe we made the right decision, & quot; said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop the investigation because of a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, which alleged that a $96,000 payment from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there was not enough evidence that the money was anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton found lobbyist work thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign.
An e-mail from December 2008 shows that, after the company continued to use Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, had a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was knocking on the door of the Interior Department regarding a matter concerning & quot;.
Mr. Ensign had also arranged to lunch with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allegiant Air, and asked the Secretary of Transportation to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after it hired Mr. Hampton for lobbying purposes.
When information about this affair became public for the first time last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and abandoned his position in the Senate, where he had been fourth in the Republican ranking.
After many months off, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was seeking a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign would no longer be the target of police inquiries, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hoped that the Ethics Commission would follow very quickly the example of the Department of Justice and stop its inquiries.
& quot; Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work serving the people of Nevada. & quot; said she.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tapped away in the courtroom riots.
Every minute of every second, they sent out their reports of gruesome testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the rape and bed-chained children trial in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely-watched trial of Steven J. Hayes, accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will officially end when the judge's verdict on the jury's death sentence is released.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed motions in court, laying out reasons for an appeal and that the courts will occupy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that through the intense coverage of the trial - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporter - there has been a & quot; circus atmosphere & quot; and such a widespread, immediate penetration of inflammatory details that the jury has been unacceptably influenced by the public outrage.
This objection could cause the appellate courts to deal with the issue of whether the new technologies make necessary new rules in the courtroom.
& quot; Just as I experienced during this trial, I believe that there is really a danger when the introduction of the new technologies into the courtroom influences every individual's right to a fair trial & quot;, said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes lead defense attorney.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeal, issued a short and concise rejection of the motions last week when he said that the new media would be carefully inspected & quot;, and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on the matter.
For decades, court filings have found that reporting on notorious cases casts doubt on the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court overturned the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland, who allegedly killed his wife. He said in his decision that there would have been a & quot; carnival atmosphere in the & quot; courtroom because of the new media.
Some people think that the TV series and the feature film & quot; On Escape & quot; is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court objections, which consider Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later, may follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the channels of communication out of the courtroom that were unthinkable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
& quot; There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in lawsuits being pursued by a broad public, & quot; said John J. Donohue; III. Professor at Stanford Law School, who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appeal courts might be intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication out of the courtroom might make the trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many that Mr. Hayes' lawyers are laying out to delay for years, thus delaying a conviction.
Defense attorneys also contend, for instance, that Mr. Hayes may have already been convicted when Judge Blue did not allow them to test potential jurors' reactions by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have filled them with revulsion.
Defense lawyers say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge erroneously replaced a juror who was a critic of the prosecution, and that he had improperly pressured the verdict when he made the unusual decision to vacate the jury over the weekend.
Jurors were not isolated.
But their arguments about the impact of extensive coverage of the trial may attract the most interest.
In a ruling challenge they filed last month, they noted that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and had been discussed by candidates during the campaign for governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the new media has continuously rekindled the flames of emotions about the case.
& quot; Such a day-to-day rush of media beeps, cameras, and reporters outside the courtroom, & quot; lawyers wrote. & quot; has never been experienced before in New Haven, and perhaps not even nationally.
Your emphasis on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that claiming these direct news stories are more inflammatory than reports that are delivered more slowly is an anti-tech look that impoverishes reporting on future processes.
But some attorneys said appellate courts are often confronted with the argument that social and technological change requires adaptation by courts.
Mr. Hayer's attorneys reinforce that assertion.
In their appeal, they referred to the Supreme Court decision of 1966, which overturned Dr. Sheppard's conviction on the basis of coverage, and made clear that the new media requires new rules.
& quot; This case & quot;, so they wrote, & quot; represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century. & quot;
Can courtesy join the disconnect?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little civility has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of real two-party cooperation, or a moment of illusion, before quickly returning to the parties' fight in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders failed to yield a breakthrough on the big issues to deal with during the so-called & quot; lame duck session & quot;, the session at the end of a government period when no decisions are made.
After all you hear, it was neither a courteous discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of partisan point-scoring.
The president's deficit commission public meeting on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the policy differences that persist between members.
It appears to be clear that a close interaction over a period of months produces a mutual respect that masks the ideological chasm that continues to divide members from each other.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in a test phase - one demanding from the other sign of willingness to cooperate and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and voters' patience after another partisan warfare.
Thus, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its evaluation by the attendees was limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere prevailing in the past two years.
Whether it's about taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election, at least for a short time, gave Washington a soft ride.
& quot; No question, the tone has changed & quot;, said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official who now works for the & quot; Ethics and Public Policy Center & quot;.
& quot; This is inescapable after-elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions that die away again.
And that's good. & quot;
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the & quot; lame duck session & quot;, Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all of them, be it temporarily or permanently.
Similarly, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich are being cut while denying assistance to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's White House meeting, there is a growing optimism that one can agree on these issues during the & quot; lame duck session & quot; while also ratifying the New START Treaty.
But William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that a successful cooperation on pressing issues of the lame duck session & quot; does not necessarily lead to a durable cooperation of parties when the new 112th Congress is convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of non-match is more likely, maybe even unavoidable.
& quot; After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation & quot;, he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - that courtesy leads to true cooperation.
& quot; I see much that is happening from today until 2012, as a prelude, or shadow boxing, for the main 2012 event & quot;, he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who were conducive to their formation.
However concerned Republican leaders may be about playing too high a game of poker, they know they have to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and repeal health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the first reactions to the deficit commission's recommendations, which include tax reform and raising some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Vice-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken over one of the most difficult jobs in Washington, and, according to their own assessment, have been pushing so hard to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that it can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the commission to make their plan the official recommendation, and they fight hard to even get anywhere near that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, because, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise in financial issues.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and the Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take the form of party clashes next year, when Republicans will challenge Obama on the state budget, taxes, and the health care system, followed later by a period of major bipartisan cooperation.
What's going to lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It has been proven that, despite the partisanship of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
When confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public response.
Whoever is doomed to losing will have to change course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than in the mid-1990 "s, and they seem to be a bigger ideological chasm between Obama and congressional Republicans than it was at the time between President Bill Clinton and Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as just a prelude to a much more consequential election in 2012.
Viewed in this way, the courtesy worn this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will require much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still divide the two from each other.
Leaked US document portrays Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the & quot; kleptocracy & quot;, and it passes some of the bribery and protection money it collects on to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are extorting high protection money to maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it is said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the & quot; vertical of authority & quot; - takes its share of the money moving up the ladder.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow Mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is little evidence that has been cleaned up in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won numerous libel suits against such allegations.
In September, he told a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: & quot; It's crazy, it' s dirty, it's dirty. & quot;
& gt; An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt. Polls have found that.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individual persons are named, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
& quot; The Moscow government's direct connection to crime has led to some calling it a' quot; disturbance 'and concluding that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government, according to the memo.
& quot; Criminal elements enjoy a & quot; kryshna & quot; (a term from the world of criminals / the mafia, which literally means & quot; roof & quot; or protection). It spans over the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Inspectorate (MVD) and the Prosecutor's Office as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layered structure within Moscow's criminal world.
& quot; Luzhkov is ranked first. & quot;
& quot; FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second level. & quot;
& quot; Last the Ordinary Criminals and the Criminal Inspectors follow at the bottom level. & quot;
& quot; This is an incompetent system where criminal groups close a loophole in some areas because the city does not offer any help. & quot;
The report goes on to say that the FSB gets money from the biggest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
A source, it is said, & quot; explained that Moscow business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime), as they have more weapons, resources, and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by law.
& quot; For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as sought after as it used to be. & quot;
The memo notes that while collecting the money is comprehensive, the protection itself will be very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed down very quickly - due to one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The embassy memo contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
& quot; In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats & quot;, said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow-based commission of experts, in a recent interview.
& quot; But he is part of this bureaucracy. & quot;
& quot; It is not part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia. & quot;
Without a politician, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, InDem estimates, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are listed by & quot; as least corrupt & quot; to & quot; most corrupt & quot;).
The unveiling of the American embassy memo, which happened late evening after Moscow time, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, though, since Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's mistakes, it can also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that they are solving the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and reacted angrily at the revelation that American diplomats have called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
& quot; The truth is that it is about our interaction, which is a major factor of domestic politics in this country, & quot; said.
& quot; But to be honest, we were not expecting this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure, and in such an unethical way, you know. & quot;
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete-enclosed classroom with dirty and flaking walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembers the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
& quot; Everyone here loves Ta Mok. & quot;
& quot; He was a good leader and he cared about his people & quot; said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years.
Because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule known as the & quot; the butcher & quot;, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he has built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge's capitulation to the government, longtime supporters are being challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school textbook that, for the first time, tells the history of Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers.
And in July, a UN-Cambodia Joint Tribunal for the first time convicted a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fears grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Veng, complicating their efforts at reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
& quot; There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything, & quot; said Chhang Youk, head of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization researching the regime.
& quot; For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil. & quot;
& quot; It splits even families. & quot;
During Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the regime's remnants and its military fled to Cambodia' s border with Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement capitulated.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok raised the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began defecting to the government, resulting in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested in 1999 by government forces near the Dangrek Mountains.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, awaiting his trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled to the crushing poverty of rural Cambodia, and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts because they were laying down their weapons, the rank-and-file soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
& quot; These people have benefited very little from the capitulation & quot; said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums across Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
& quot; You are anchored in the regime's utopian agrarian ideology. & quot;
& quot; You grew up without any professional knowledge. & quot;
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlang Veng, before settling in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
& quot; Life Under the Khmer Rouge was good & quot;, he said.
& quot; Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat. & quot;
& quot; But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves. & quot;
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has raised concerns here as well.
Early next year, the court will try Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to condemn the old leaders and those who are chiefly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This did little to ease the anxiety in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64 years old, who served as district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007 she had told commissioners of the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had directed the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers were probably to die.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the parched grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her Khmer Rouge past.
Should the court subpoena her, she would refuse to go, she said.
& quot; Cambodia lives in peace and stability, she said.
& quot; If there were no more pursuits, there would be war here. & quot;
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court indicted more suspects, although experts and historians discuss this.
& quot; Cambodia needs to dig a hole and bury the past & quot;, he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
& quot; reconciliation with Khmer times means gathering together the broken pieces & quot;, he said.
& quot; It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that like everything can understand. & quot;
The center created the first government-approved textbook about the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page & quot; history of the Democratic Cambodia & quot;.
It distributed the book in June at Anlong Veng as an appendix to the Department of Education's High School History Book, which contains less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As often happens in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's ties to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at Anlong Veng High School said the new textbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home with him to read.
& quot; My family rejects many parts of the book and the court & quot;, he said.
& quot; You are suspicious because you are not sure how many people are condemned by the court. & quot;
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook, and the court are gradually gaining influence, & quot; said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge has a powerful appeal here.
Up in the Dangrek Mountains, a path strewn over shrubs and littered with plastic garbage leads to a rectangle of black soot covered with a rusty sheet-metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a heap of tyres.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cell phone saleswoman, said she did not know much about the man who had been burned here.
& quot; But he has a strong mind and many people here go to him to pray & quot;, she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot' s last resting place, where she's going to lay a bush of ripe bananas - in the hope that it will bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to cease accumulating non-weapons grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials around the world, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarussian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article from the Security Summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to persuade Belarus to stop collecting highly enriched uranium, and seemed to have reached a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that in the past two months, two secret agreements were made with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarus research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material -- about 500 pounds, according to an official who remains anonymous because of the sensitivity of the subject.
The deal appears to be one of the key results from Obama's 47-nation nuclear security summit in April, which excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the next summit in 2012.
& quot; I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat at the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012). & quot;
& quot; This proves to me that it works & quot;, said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership Global Security, a group promoting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal & quot; a very significant, important step & quot; Belarus; took.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
& quot; How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is basically weapons grade, and less enriched uranium & quot;, Lukashenko said at the time.
& quot; This is our raw material... We will not make any dirty bombs out of it and we will not sell & quot; to anybody.
& quot; We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all & quot;.
Nevertheless, Belarus came close to the US a few months ago when it showed interest in reaching an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' s uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily radioactive, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government pays $14 million for this effort, with much of the money going to Belarusian research involving low-enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
& quot; This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust & quot; had with the deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a Department of Energy representative working on global threat reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its camp by 2012, according to the Joint Agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
& quot; Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announce that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in the improvement of bilateral relations, and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens & quot;, she explains.
No objections by the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA's flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as shown in a telegram sent by the U.S. Ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents revealed by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper & quot; El País & quot; (by cable). It is added that former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega requested that the Spanish government be informed, & quot; to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are being adequately supervised.
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe denouncing aid to human rights violating practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed each other.
The deputy prime minister admitted that the council's report had hit Zapatero' s side & quot; and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
& quot; De la Vega stressed that Spain had no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory. & quot;
& quot; You just want to be informed & quot; not to catch & quot; off guard & quot;, reports Aguirre per cable.
Also the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the Ambassador that the Spanish government does not want to pay much attention to this matter, though the government has little leverage, since these are in the hands of the judges.
For his part, the Attorney General Vicente González made it clear to the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents of the Spanish Central Intelligence Agency (CNI) and the Minister of Defense about the CIA flights.
& quot; These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information, & quot; said the ambassador after a meeting with the prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the US was more concerned about the & quot; apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors & quot; than about the declassified information from the CNI and the Defense Ministry.
& quot; This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts at discreet handling among governments, & quot; complains Aguirre.
At a lunch in March 2007, attended by the US Ambassador and the Spanish Minister of the Interior, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that although the Spanish judges are insanely attached to their independence and do what they consider appropriate & quot;, he had given his staff instructions to avoid making inflamed rhetorical comments in order to defuse the tension. & quot;
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
& quot; Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience tells us that the PP will not doubt to capitalize on an indication that the Zapatero government tolerated, or deliberately ignored, U.S. actions that could be construed as possible human rights violations, even if these exposures could have a negative impact on the U.S. government, he points out.
The childkiller confesses to having complained on the internet about the anguish & quot; caused by motherhood.
The young woman was speaking of the child when it was already dead and she had a blog: & quot; Terror Galician style & quot;
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet & quot; Muki & quot;.
Under this epithet, which she uses from a young age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both hail from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
To understand them, you have to know their love life, which the ABC daily reconstructs based on testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman started a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted one year.
Shortly after she dissolved her relationship, it was revealed she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was of him, but his ex never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly thereafter, she entered into another relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around on the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of her messages it can be concluded that her love affair broke up and she parted ways.
In March 2008 she is alone on Menorca, writing: & quot; Alberto is very strange and sour because I came here to work. & quot;
& quot; When I told him this, he thought it was good, but now he of course notices what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free to be able to do and leave whatever he wants. & quot;
Later she mentions a message she's just received on her mobile phone: & quot; I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send the boy to you. & quot;
She complains: & quot; If he does not like me leaving the boy with my mother, I 'll fetch him when I am back. & quot;
In May she speaks about returning to her village: & quot; This week I am going there, but I will only stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20. if I do not want to lose the. & quot;
She declares she will take her firstborn with her if all goes well.
& quot; He will be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him again with anyone except my mother & quot;, a dubious intention considering their bad relationship.
In July there is another mail.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10. is dead.
& quot; On the one hand César is happy, on the other hand it is not. & quot;
& quot; On the one hand, he is with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other hand, he has to go to school every day. & quot;
She is talking about moving to Mallorca.
& quot; There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expenditure on the nanny. & quot;
On the 17th: Alarms and Lamentations.
& quot; A giant kiss from César asking me when you come. & quot;
& quot; Alberto says he sent me some videos on email. You see, if he wants to, he finds me, such a crap. & quot;
On the 30th one more: & quot; The boy is fine. He's going to a summer class to learn Catalan. & quot;
From Víctor, her current partner, there is a: & quot; He is pushing money at me. & quot;
There are messages from her on the Internet, in anime and manga logs.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked, and in which she called herself & quot; Muki, the prison releaser & quot;
& quot; Terror a la gallega (heading) & quot;.
The last man to live with her, a sworn hunting warden, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can 't believe it all happened because she hadn' t told him she's a single mum.
Mónica was yesterday transferred from the Center for Prisoners of Court on Menorca to the Palma Provincial Prison.
The mandatory defender, Carlos Maceda, declared that she could not remember the course of the facts, & quot;, and that she did not intend to cause any harm to the little one.
However, she had previously confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and storing his corpse in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutor requested a psychiatric report.
Partido Popular gained 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the November 28th results, the PP could play a critical role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona, and Barcelona
After the significant increase in the number of votes and MEPs in the recent regional elections, the PP already has its eyes set on the parliamentary elections - sooner or not. Its expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party gets in these elections is normally twice as much as in the elections in Catalonia.
For example, the People's Party of Catalonia received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, whereas this number was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If this ascending trend - the result of the PSC's diversion of the vote share and of the PP' s electorate's binding - persists, the PP' s analysts predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 Congress deputies, while CiU would gain four (it now has 10), and the PSC would lose at least 9 deputies (out of 25).
These calculations attest to Catalonia's fundamental importance to PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could keep its MP or gain one extra.
However, if the election calendar is to be maintained, the next date for municipal elections will be in May 2011. Then again, the Popular Party (PP) may be the tongue in the cheek to put an end to socialist supremacy, in four provincial capitals, and with its majority in Barcelona City Council, one of the municipal authorities with the largest budget: €661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists do not have a majority, nor can they rely on their traditional allies (the ERC and the ICV).
After the republican debacle, it is no accident that this party will lose its representation in Barcelona's municipal council, where it would have to win 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of the vote in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona's turnaround. There they had governed together with the PP prior to the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - they met several times during the last election campaign.
Also in other important places, like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the Volkspartei has seen a significant increase.
Currently, the PP has a presence in 34 municipalities in Catalonia, and aims to create lists in as many locations as possible.
The Catalan cell obtained thousands of passports for Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by officers from the Barcelona Police Intelligence Unit were members of a Thai-controlled jihadist cell that provided passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including the & quot; Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam & quot; (LTTE) and & quot; Lashkar e-Taiba & quot; (Let) - the latter was the author of the bombings in Bombay that killed 106 people in 2008).
The Spanish Minister of the Interior attaches great importance to these investigations, going so far as to assure that with the & quot; operation Kampai & quot; the counterfeiting apparatus of Al Qaeda has been weakened & quot; globally. & quot; therefore, & quot; has become & quot; "s ability to act.
The researchers assume that in the two years that the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were falsified, and then sent to the groups that make up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda, so that their & quot; fighters could cross the borders of European and other Western countries with impunity.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigation bodies, other European police units have been involved in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the territory of the EU in the coming days to the one that took place in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad, and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another one was carried out in Thailand. The Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested, as was the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
You had run the cell based in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was nullified in 2009 - in particular stole passports from tourists in accordance with the defaults of the so-called & quot; International Islamic Front.
This means that the documents had to be issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 years old, and had to be valid for several more years; they could not have visa stamps.
It is underlined in investigative circles that no evidence has yet been found of any connection between those arrested in Catalonia and the bombing in Bombay, though the author of the attack, & quot; Lashkar e-Taiba & quot;, was one of the groups of people who obtained the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it is worth remembering that a few days before the assassination attempt from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent, through a money transfer company, invested in buying prepaid cards for & quot; mobile phones. These cards were later used by members of the & quot; command that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized an extensive amount of documentation.
PP asks Mas to delay tax agreement
PPC Chair Alicia Sánchez-Camacho took the opportunity yesterday to personally submit to Artur Mas' s terms of support for his inauguration as prime minister to the Generalitat. These are no different from those made during the election campaign, and can be summed up by the priority of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist-independence adventures, such as a fiscal settlement proposed by the regionalist leader at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Popular Party of Catalonia approached Artur Mas with the assurance given to her by the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a figure more than sufficient to feel indispensable. Because the candidate from the CiU bourgeois-regionalist party depends on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming Congress parliamentary elections depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks Mas is currently having with the remaining party chiefs revolve around Catalonia.
As for the PPC's party leader, she is calling for & quot; to support the inauguration of the party; to back off any discourse that concerns Catalonia' s sovereignty and independence, as well as an agreement on financial settlement between the state and the Autonomous Region - as in the Basque Country - and which the CiU party chief even wants to subject to a referendum.
What both leaders have in common is that they want to streamline the hyped regional administration's political apparatus, and abolish inheritance and gift tax.
PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat deal with the details of the Mas inauguration negotiation.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home affirms that the deaths are not due to & quot; missing action & quot;
Olot home owners do not rule out that their keeper killed over eleven elderly people
The leaders of the La Caritat nursing home for the elderly in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday, in which they highlighted the damage done to the institution by the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmé - the carer who, while working there, had killed at least eleven elderly people he was responsible for.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, appeared in court and announced that & quot; La Caritat would like to sue the person responsible (for the cases of death). & quot; law and our liability force us to accept the lawsuit and the civil liability for & quot;.
Not only does the institution have to accept a loss of social reputation because it did not detect the caretaker's criminal activities in time, but now it has to pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the victims' relatives.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he has continued to murder since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but rather that the formalities due to their age and illnesses were handled over the phone.
The head of La Caritat denied this point outright, stating that failure to take action could have been the cause of the incidents at the time.
La Caritat's lawyer added that there was no evidence in the litigation of any negligent action by any person other than the accused.
Already baptized as the & quot; death angel, & quot; confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday, declaring that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009, and one and a half months later, the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various tranquilizers.
The director of La Caritat explained that the access of the personnel to the medicines is difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the tranquilizer cocktail on six out of nine crimes committed by the patient to free the patient from suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory tests will highlight whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less gruesome death for his first victims, or whether he burned them from the inside by giving them bleach, as he had done to three women he murdered between October 12 and 17, according to his confession.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the testimony of the keeper, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements to the court and that it does not make sense to suddenly change his approach after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to the justice for this reason, and to elucidate the scope of these incidents.
Threat gestures from the European Central Bank (ECB)
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat from ECB President Trichet, who warned that the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.
The risk spreads of the euro periphery countries have increased dramatically, and the shares of European banks are up more than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can deceive itself, and that the euro has barely gained points, which is cause for concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market that recovers as it collapses, albeit as a result of short and highly speculative positions being closed down.
The institutional investor will not lose its fear by a long way.
One month ago today the European Central Bank told us to reverse our liquidity operations, after which the ECB will have to pull back tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank requested that the sovereign debt purchase plan be terminated, as it would be ineffective, as well as that all extraordinary liquidity temporary measures be removed. Only a one-week indefinite access should be maintained.
After the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to extend & quot; at least until March. With unlimited access at the end of the quarter, the quot; quot; should be retained until at least June to ensure liquidity.
We also expect the bond purchase program to continue, issuing a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday will be set back again, and if it is stubbornly insisted that we withdraw our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As with the ECB meeting in May, where the bank reaffirmed that it would not consider buying sovereign debt, and the markets collapsed as a result, this history could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May it showed the teeth and on Wednesday it said it had already bought a lot, thereby provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government securities in Portugal was quite weak.
The State Asset Management issued only 500 million at 5.28%, against 750 million at 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nonetheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the entire curve, reflecting a shift in the way markets perceive them, according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland debt hole have been published.
The sum is estimated to be about 10 000 million in the short term, with a possible 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland completely lost its credibility after failing to recognize the problem with the July stress tests, the numbers under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must obtain parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday. As it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her discourse more moderate ahead of the December 14 Heads of State and Government Summit, where political unity is needed to show that we can play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, and the other countries Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.
The President of the Spanish Government yesterday unveiled the Action Plan, which is due to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the Autonomous Regions as with the financial institutions, reduction of the state deficit, liberalization, privatization and job creation measures. Measures that ring like Vivaldi's Four Seasons in the ears of investors.
The Zapatero and Trichet dual effect explains why the Spanish stock exchange has gained 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction from the government and the Spanish Central Bank has been fast and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will take advantage of the Trichet effect. That is why we are betting on strong demand that will eliminate any doubts about our ability to refinance.
For Spain, requesting an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity we do n 't need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros at its disposal, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are exceedingly expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in keeping with Caesar's Wife: & quot; Now it is not just being that counts, but appearances as well. & quot;
Only courage, we can do that!
Eulen CEO challenges Vega Sicilia shareholders' meeting at his children's request
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the owls and El Enebro societies, is not abating.
David Álvarez, founder of the company gurppe, will contest the shareholder meeting of El Enebro, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers it to be absolutely null & quot;. His children will try to obtain a majority to control the company's governing bodies - owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal action for a new chapter of justice in their dispute for control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company services company does not appear willing to give in on his legal fight for control of the organs of El Enebro.
He has been ousted from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who will become Board members at the January 18 shareholder meeting of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Register of Companies.
The General Meeting of Shareholders of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Number 2 Commercial Court of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunder in the bosom of the Álvarez family.
Invoking the magistrate to schedule the assembly is the only legal way to ensure the convening of the general meeting of shareholders.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a & quot; desperate means of the petitioner - his five children - to have & quot; nullified the January 18th meeting, as official spokesmen explain, by means of legal quibbles, fraudulent machinations and abuse of rights.
This reasoning is the basis for the contesting of the assembly afterwards, to declare & quot; absolutely null & quot;.
The same protagonists who cover themselves in discreet silence tried unsuccessfully to convene a meeting by judicial route in June already.
At El Enebro - property company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez & apos;'s seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to the family protocols, the founder of the services group demands the right to use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background to the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the handling of the contesting suit, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins F1 with a Siemens secret weapon
The trolleys are enhanced in real-time using software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history has been marked by surprises and successes in this exquisite universe of speed.
Initially nobody paid attention to the newcomer, and despite its steeply ascending trajectory during the last few seasons, everyone was counting on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferraris for the final sprint last November.
Without wishing to detract from the abilities of the German pilot and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of the Renault engine, the & quot; secret weapon, which Multi Siemens put in Red Bull hands, thus creating a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, this is a powerful software for simulating processes. The German company launched it in 2007 for purposes other than car racing.
This informatics program, known as PLM, was used for developing assembly chains in factories around the world, power plants, and high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce or simulate a product or process faithfully before it is actually built, in order to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi' s aircraft, and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industry division, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 - factory Red Bull & quot; in a few hours, almost in real-time & quot; can design and execute the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests.
Russwurm points out that in 1992, there were an average of ten technicians working in the race stables. They could introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Today, in Red Bull's team, there are 180 highly skilled young people. Using powerful computer systems, they perform analyses and all sorts of changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software was capable of analysing and improving all the components of Red Bull's race cars, except for the engine for which only Renault claims to be responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be transferred from the simulator's virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production equipment and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit that is set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for designing and manufacturing its race cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits - especially from journalists - are very limited.
All that is happening there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, World Champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 hero is undoubtedly the newest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts into service for its participation on the racetracks, there are other protagonists whose support is priceless and whose notoriety is zero.
The plant's chief technology officer, Steve Nevey, emphasized that five years ago, it was still possible to say that advances in R & amp; E for racing cars contributed 50 percent to victory, with pilots responsible for the rest.
Today share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilots' contribution is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by computerized because they are unpredictable gladiators & quot;.
HP will open twenty own stores of local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a network of twenty stores, each measuring 80 to 100 square meters, that Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The Company is agreeing to this initiative with the 16 multi-brand outlets that already exist, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España vice president Helena Herrero cited as an example the remodeled store on Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group intends to establish 200 outlets in Europe by 2010, of which 20 are located in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the new openings to come, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next destination.
The deputy chairwoman, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the store opening philosophy is always the same. She bases herself on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group advises them and takes over the exclusive store outfit (with interactive products to touch). In Europe all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for training store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising scheme and highlighted that the intention with the exclusive network of outlets is to optimize & quot; customer service and advise small and micro businesses on purchasing and thereafter, even the packaging.
The Store in Barcelona has a Pioneer Pilot program that resolves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An on-line service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
& quot; This is how we can solve problems in ten minutes, which can sometimes take up to two days. & quot;
& quot; This system was designed especially for small- and micro-businesses as well as retail customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical after-sales service & quot; explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to steal & apos; one million customers from its rival in three years.
Banco Sabadell Executive Board member Jaime Guardiola is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a tough year for banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Nevertheless, he foresees a slump in interest margins, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture a million private customers in three years - a subject yet to be completed.
Sabadell found the way to exhaust the coming three years, thus surviving in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without making use of the FROB's public assistance, but also to expand the market share by one million retail customers - 700,000 if you take the customers that the bank will lose. That is the big challenge facing this bank because, until now, it has paid more attention to its business clients than to its retail clients.
It has added 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses this year.
Its retail customer market share is 3.5 per cent, while business customers make up more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, ie; austerity, to reduce costs. The challenges the bank will face in doing so will be presented together with the year-end report.
Only a few banks dare to set targets and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has thrown all banks' plans into disarray around the world.
Sabadell will complete its Optima four-year guideline this year. This was initially scheduled for three years, but due to the market situation, it has been extended by one year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main target of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a difficult & quot; year for & quot; with large reach.
The manager assumes that Spain will just come & quot; slowly out of the crisis.
Moreover, it would be very difficult for & quot; to create & quot; work in two or three years. & quot; is fundamental to the banks' survival.
Even if he assumes that the war on liabilities - which penalizes the interest margins - will subside, the risk premiums that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issues to preserve liquidity will already be shifted onto the price of loans, in compensation for dwindling profit margins.
& quot; The issues of liquidity and financing are of a structural nature and they will put pressure on the loans. & quot;
& quot; We did n 't turn off the tap, but the interest differentials are very high & quot;, admitted Guardiola.
Banesto already issued an order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and increase the interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the idea of raising & quot; fees, but within a competitive framework.
Sabadell's guiding plan is based on organic growth, though the group, as ever, does not exclude corporate deals.
Not in vain does he assure that in Spain & quot; larger companies are necessary. & quot;
& quot; Everything will change & quot; in the coming year, he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently & quot; vastly increasing. & quot; does not exclude that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into the red.
He believes the FROB can replace the money market when capitals are added.
After assuring that Sabadell could survive even a temporary shutdown of the markets, he debases the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stresses that nothing can be put into circulation, but unlike what happened in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repo operations, thereby cushioning the crisis.
CECA excludes a second wave of savings banks merger
CECA Director General José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday dismissed the possibility of a wave of savings banks merging, stressing the speed with which the industry is being restructured.
When the concentration process of Spanish savings banks began, several of them insisted on not participating in the first phase. They kept the second round to themselves.
However, the Director General of the Spanish Savings Banks Confederation (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta assured that this second round would not take place.
& quot; I believe that most of the mergers are completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round. It was more a matter of adjustments. & quot;
& quot; The major part is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventeenths, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, which strongly supported all operations. & quot;
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process for & quot; was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the schedule, which was determined in earlier times, not now, in the business plans with Banco de España & quot;, he emphasized.
& quot; The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28,000 million assets to 17 with 75,500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent, and they are now much larger, thus fulfilling the Basle Agreement & quot;, he emphasized.
Olavarrieta explained that & quot; there were a number of unresolved opinions about the slowness of the process, which revealed the seriousness and absurdity of & quot; because & quot; Banco de España is exhorting us to complete on time before the end of the year. & quot;
The CECA's Director General, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe, and maybe & quot; the whole world, adding that those who doubt this will do & quot; without deeper knowledge of & quot;.
The manager remarked that in the current economic cycle, we do n 't have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks. They have undergone a very significant & quot; concentration process, which & quot; will complete & quot; as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests conducted by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and Germany's Red Line
Berlin has decided to keep the euro, but at the same time imposed conditions for the whole of the European Union.
Tensions in the markets have triggered a dual response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has proposed new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro enterprises, regulation of temporary work agencies, or the cancellation of the 426 euro assistance for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state's lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of the government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former head of the government, Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for evoking the current crisis.
How are these operations to be understood?
Let's face it, Merkel' s position is not a mistake in her public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
In doing so, Germany is adopting a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, one that conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a majority of its partners.
Faced with the resistance in Europe, one begins speculating in Germany about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: the re-introduction of the Deutsche Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - supported by a large part of public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third: a re-shaping of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; punishing countries that exceed the targets; possibly the default of some countries, as well as extending the cost of potential adjustment to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been looming for some time. So there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created deficit incentives, and the German government pulled off a constitutional reform of its own to prevent this from 2016 onwards.
This was the first sign of the drifting apart between what Germany thought was necessary (strict fiscal plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second signal was sent to the central European country, as Merkel painfully delayed the decision to save Greece.
At that time this was heavily criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a bailout of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel is coming out again with a clear position. She is calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements in order to allow the rescue of a country while at the same time obliging the private lenders to bear part of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it propelled the Ireland crisis and everything that followed.
But your proposal, albeit somewhat sweetly, was accepted. In the next few months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union that will enable these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line which it does not intend to cross.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - the old functionality of the Euro will not exist anymore after this date.
2013 will be the year a new currency is born, in which the offending countries will be severely punished, can be forced to declare insolvent, and in this case the private sector will have to bear some of the costs.
Germany is showing us that we need to embark on a tough course of growth, with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, improvement in productivity and competitiveness, as well as positive external balances.
The other alternative, based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as led by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do bad at not understanding it.
It's not just about bringing the state deficit down to three per cent by 2013.
Demands are much tougher.
And the worst we could do in these conditions is to cheat ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will pass in more serenity.
And that we will make use of the opportunities we are given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this well, and his dual announcement (the promised reforms after the meeting with the big business last Saturday, and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in one's own home has made its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it does not look like that would change anything about it.
Among the possibilities considered is that we would have to leave the euro area stuffed with little serious countries, not to be excluded.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it has warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against Ajax show ingenuity, but not a willingness to bypass a sanction.
The exclusion allegedly instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink to be spilled over whether it was an unsporting act or not and whether possibly both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As everyone knows, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already won decisively) and played several fouls for the referee to show them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will fulfill the prescribed sanction on the next league game against the Auxerre, thus entering the next phase of play without any cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club' s coach, José Mourinho, with two matches and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten rules followed in this sport.
Part of the debate that has arisen around the case is due to a team of Real Madrid football club (who pretended nobility and honor in their anthem and on other occasions punished their players for similar incidents) playing the lead role in it, and due to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this behaviour, which is not explicitly prohibited by the statutes, contravenes the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute rule circumvention. In fact, this procedure adheres to the statutes of sport, but seem to circumvent their meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused by the sportsspirit should be investigated.
The sportsspirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect not jeopardized by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to prevent the offending players from taking any undue advantage from the counter team. Again, that was not done.
The paradox of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it does not correspond to what we usually understand to false play or rule circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was n 't secretly performed to avoid a sanction, but rather it should be as conspicuous as possible, so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and joyfully accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the offender drew from the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was neither placed in a less favorable position nor advantages were demanded for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not then have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without any cards, which could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-run, to a certain degree of an uncertain advantage, since the team could eventually exit as well. Also, with this approach players get a sanction and move on to the second card cycle, where they are eliminated due to accumulation with one card less than in the first cycle.
This makes it not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against sportsmanship, which includes strategic choices to maximize the benefits of the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to circumvent a sanction (this would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they rather chose when to submit to it.
You made a strategic choice, without dodging or fleeing from a penalty.
Although the boundary between Inventive Gift and Rule Environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of Inventive Gift.
I get the impression that the polemic arose as a result of two factors: Because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the way the rule transfer was provoked.
The damage done to the principles of sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offer offensive for client catering for group Christmas dinners in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar drops this year an avalanche of reservations on the days 16. and 17. of December.
The celebrations paid by employees themselves are spreading. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 Euro.
Like the turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to Christmas, providing oxygen to Barcelona's hospitality and leisure industries. But, as a result of the economic crisis, they are triggering a price war to catch even the customer segment that is the big crowd: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
To make accounting a bit more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has all orders dropped in the week beginning on December 13th, with the result of an avalanche of dinner reservations on two top-class warehouses (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders placed the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times started, many companies have stopped group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to have to renounce this tradition, many workers pay it out of their own pocket.
No matter how the economy is, minimum prices are required, confirms Gaietà Farràs, President of the Barcelona Hospitality Council.
The representative of the Dachverband does not dare to predict yet what the holidays will look like in this month.
& quot; People think twice about & apos; umpteen times before making a reservation. & quot;
& quot; You 'd like to go out, but you pay a lot of attention to prices & quot;, he stresses.
Business will go well with those who offer quality at good prices with good service & quot;, he adds. It reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices around 25 euro are demanded most.
A survey of various centrally located restaurants reveals that the evening of December 17 leads to the collapse of the vendors.
The Soteras group says demand for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 Euros is booming. The group has adjusted its menus, with all-in-one offers ranging from 25 to 35 Euros, according to the economic situation.
For another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 eateries in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda, and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to advance bookings even from the beginning of November.
& quot; We made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste from $19.95 to $30, & quot; he explains.
AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 eateries, is not losing its optimism, after revenues started to flourish again since the second quarter and a good, if a few-day-focused, outlook for the Christmas business is anticipated.
Sources at the group of companies point out that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu has been added to the six group menus for 30 Euro or more as a price hit. You get the impression that the customers are willing to spend 10% more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as cava.
Also in some companies you can see green sprouts, so the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are in recovery again.
On the side of the umbrella federation Fecasarm (with associations like the pub, restaurant and leisure federation of Barcelona), vice chairman Enric Gomà trusts to see the end of the tunnel on it and notes that overall the reservations are quite & quot; lively & quot;, although the customers beat out & quot; a maximum & quot;.
However, no matter who pays, the fun of celebrating has not diminished.
Pakistani nuclear program causes major concern in US
Islamabad makes & quot; nuclear weapons faster than any other country.
Revelations by Wikileaks confirm Taliban-Pakistan relations.
The contents of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirm the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
In the margin of the clarifying and juicy details provided by the documents on the contents of the talks and the way of thinking of the accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that the cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not strengthened, but on the contrary & quot; decreases & quot;, and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons & quot; at a faster rate than any other country.
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in case of a possible attack - give Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are listed by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones: The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable dispersion of the nuclear material, and the vulnerability of transporting nuclear material.
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer viewed by the U.S., but also by Russia, as a rampant and reason to exercise caution.
& quot; Pakistan needs to hire strictly faithful personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs, said the expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assange's Internet portal is that US-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is waning, as is the increased pace at which Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy describing communication with Pakistan as a 'quot; frustrating & quot; quot;' declares: 'quot; Often there is no transparency; on offers of aid, we do not get replies or they are rejected'.
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the State Intelligence Service for South Asia, confirms that despite Pakistan's economic catastrophe, & quot; is producing nuclear weapons faster than any other country.
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington, during a visit by the chief of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to clarify to the officer in charge of the mission, & quot; that Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups.
Chasing Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a senior counter-terrorism officer to prevent new disclosures.
Interpol issues a red warning for tracking and finding Assange.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to elucidate.
Yesterday Interpol issued a & quot; red warning & quot; to find and pursue & quot; from Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
Besides, it is not new, it's from 20th November.
It also has nothing to do with the latest disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but to do with the allegations of sexual abuse facing the Australian in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer for the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures the police that they know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at Sweden's request, but it was not disclosed until yesterday after the Swedish authorities had received the authority.
That is how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are assigned to identify and trace Assange, & quot; to temporarily arrest and extradite him.
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organization, many member countries consider the red warning to be a carte blanche for an arrest - to be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be.
The move outraged Assange's lawyers, who published a letter informing him that the 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to answer the Swedish authorities' questions via video conference.
You also recall that Assange requested to leave Sweden, and received the appropriate authorization from the prosecutor, who is likened to the fabled Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin's security chief.
& quot; This is like a hunt, not a legal pursuit & quot; is accused in the letter.
While the world searches for him - and his mother, from Australia, professes her son's innocence - Assange is in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an unspecified location. At the meeting, he requested the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
& quot; If it can be proved that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN, violating international conventions signed by the US, she would have to resign & quot;, he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who called the request for resignation 'ridiculous and absurd & quot;.'
& quot; I am not sure why we should value the opinion of a type with a web site & quot;, he explained to the station CNN.
Obama himself has assigned a senior counter-terrorism officer, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama's spokesman to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King. Starting in January, he will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives. He has called on the state department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, to seize & quot; their funds, and to prosecute anyone who supports them or contributes.
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to retract his statement that Assange must be assassinated & quot;.
& quot; Obama would have to turn it into a target and use an unmanned aircraft or something. & quot;
The one who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
& quot; Whoever it was who leaked information into the government, he is guilty of betrayal and anything that is not an execution is a too-lenient punishment & quot;, he told the channel Fox.
Puigcercós with a wink to the Carod Close Peace in the ERC seeks
The Republican leader allows the party to hold a secret ballot on his or her continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the plenary principle.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found a recipe for avoiding for the umpteenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after losing 11 deputies and half of the electorate votes.
The leader of the party is aware that his threat to resign is not enough for those close to former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weakened today as its mentor itself, and will not cause him the same headache as other former currents.
This is why the leader of Esquerra, with a twinkle in his eye, is trying to win over the new critics. This would secure his position until the next municipal elections.
For starters, announced yesterday that ERC's over 200-plus regional council members could vote in secrecy about his or her remaining in office.
With ballots, not raised hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a penalty slip, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and the impression of subservience to his person.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would not feel validated with half the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages that a result in the & quot; Bulgarian-style & quot; would also not be good.
Those close to Carod are demanding more from the president than just giving his office to the party. An insufficient gesture, since Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will agree a schedule of action from now until May with the board.
For this, they expect to be able to participate in the drafting of the document on Strategic Reorientation, which the leadership will submit to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, the latter is to promise to bring forward the Congress to the fall of 2011, which the party leadership already regards as a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC believes that the & quot; polyphony & quot; is bad for stability and he strives once and for all to get the organization to be able to do its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the incumbent conseller Josep Huguet on his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party leader would support & quot; in exchange for various purposes & quot;.
He listed five of which two are in the foreground.
Firstly, the & quot; restructuring of the Board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, is called the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second might be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the full-assembly principle as a way of working.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the bylaws to make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates.
Puigcercós & apos; team is obsessed with finishing the plenary model. This is an exception in the Spanish party system. It is like Puigcercós having already fought for it on the last two congresses.
In fact, at the 2008 trembling assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the plenary principle at a congress that was to deal with reforming the statutes.
This date has not yet been scheduled because infogle of the internal turmoil of recent years, tackling this issue was not advisable.
Now, without critical sectors in wait, may be the time to resume this matter, and finish forever.
23 Killed in November, 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO count, there were four fewer cases in México than there were in 2010.
In November, 23 people were murdered in México, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO México count.
Among those killed are three women and the discovery of two amputated bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, we come to 390 deaths in total, which is probably related to organized crime.
Among the cases, one stands out in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, a town in Toluca.
The subject had at least three bullets caused by firearms, the mercy shot was fired at his head, and feet and hands were tied with a cable.
The next day, the body of a person was found in the trunk of a vehicle parked on Mixtecas Street in the Santa Cruz Acatlán community of Naucalpan Municipality.
On Thursday the 4th, early in the morning, farm workers found a body with traces of torture and at least three fatal bullets to the chest on the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway on the section that crosses the village of Villa Guerrero.
A message believed to have been signed by the Crimean organization La Familia Michoacana was found next to the body.
A day later, a 50-year-old man was shot eight times after leaving his house to do his work as a garbage truck driver.
On November 7th two 30-year-old men died as a result of being shot in the head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc settlement of the town of Ecatepec.
In Chalcro, the body of a man was found with a mercy shot wound to the forehead on a lonely path in the El Naranjo settlement and a cartridge shell fired using a.caliber firearm was found underneath the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were discovered in the sewer of the Golondrina settlement.
Emergency services searched for the remaining parts of the body but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported the discovery of a body they had discovered in the Peña Colorada area, with their hands tied behind each other and their heads bound.
The man had a wound stemming from shooting a firearm into the neck.
In the middle of the month there were reports of the murder of two men who were wrapped in blankets and discovered in the trunk of a vehicle parked on the streets of Tizapán de Zaragoza municipality's Villas de la Hacienda. In addition to the victims, two death threats were also found.
A day later, a human head was found in a cardboard box in the settlement of Valle de los Reyes, in the locality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby settlement, the rest of the body was found in a black plastic bag with a message signed by El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women wrapped in blankets were discovered in the Zoquiapan settlement of the commune of Ixtapaluca. The next morning, the body of a man wrapped in a yellow-and-blue blanket was found in Huixquilucan. According to the news left by his killers, it was probably Mario Ríos.
In the San Francisco Acuautla housing estate of Ixtapaluca, a woman's lifeless body was found with bullets lodged in her neck.
On the woman's skin were discovered Santa Muerte tattoos as well as chains with corresponding images.
In the last half of the month, the body of a man was found next to a vehicle in Zinacantepec township, with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of two men whose heads were covered with duct tape and a message were discovered in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
Opposite the body was a message, probably signed by a criminal organization, which read: 'This is happening to those who are not participating.'
In Ecatepec, two bodies tied to hands and feet with traces of torture were found inside a taxi parked behind the Justice Center of the San Agustín Municipality.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were discovered in the communities of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was decapitated in the village of Cuchilla Ancon and wrapped in black plastic bags, with a message lying next to it. The second had been tortured and was found in a plastic bag in the streets of the village of Juárez.
Beside him, police found a cardboard box with a message.
China Maintains Its Goals to Reduce Greenhouse Gases
The representative of China declared at COP16 that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce trace carbon emissions, and that it would maintain its offer of reducing 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th United Nations World Climate Change Summit (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country has made tremendous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that China's strategy on climate change is structured around four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building, and pilot program support.
Progress has been made on all aspects, including the adoption last year of a new energy bill, which includes goals on reducing emissions of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had worked together with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the goals of saving energy, using energy effectively and reducing emissions.
In addition, he explained, some multi-year plans have already been started or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those that received money from other countries.
For example, he was referring to the Effective Use of Energy program, which was introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another on replacing traditional light bulbs with energy-saving bulbs, and another on mitigation and adaptation, he said.
Martin Krol, government scientific adviser on climate change issues in this country, confirmed that China's efforts are far greater than is commonly thought.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons per person. China is responsible for a nine percent overall contribution to environmental pollution.
It is also making unprecedented strides in energy usage. Energy efficiency has increased by twenty percent over the past five years, and another is due to happen by 2020, he said.
Espino Exclusion Legal: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former Panist party chairman had the right to go to the National Order Commission and demand what the right allows him to.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was lawful, and that the former PAN party chairman had the right to appeal to the National Law Enforcement Commission and ask for what the law allows him to do.
In an interview that preceded Gabino Cué Monteagudos' appointment as the state governor, he stated that Espino's dismissal was a local-level decision.
& quot; It is an independent decision of the Sonoran Law Enforcement Commission. & quot;
& quot; Mr. Espino has the right to go to the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional for a decision to be made by a competent authority in his case, & quot; added.
On the other hand, he said, it is not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance on the presidential candidate has never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional would emerge strengthened from the internal vote on 4 and 5 December to elect his successor.
& quot; Das (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the bargaining table, at least not yet. It was a proposal for the municipal election; it was successful and fulfilled its purpose & quot; said.
The Pan leader declared that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, therefore, & quot; internal competition does not scare us. On the contrary, & quot; we enjoy it and it strengthens us & quot;, he commented.
He said that the council would no doubt select the best chairperson or chairperson Acción Nacional needs for the next three years. Therefore, he would hand over the stafette & quot; to whoever the council would choose.
& quot; I am completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to give each of the five the office of party chairman. & quot;
He predicted that the party's upswing recorded in the last 4 July elections would be reflected in the next elections, though it was not time to think about 2012.
& quot; Now it's about helping Governor Gabino Cué with his job.
In this regard, he emphasized that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla, and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. Therefore, & quot; places many hopes and longings in them, and I am sure that Gabino is up to the mark. & quot;
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for discord in his four-year rule, César Nava called on PRI supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
& quot; If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should start defending them, should they finally get out of the closet & quot;, he asserted.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government would be able to make expressions like those in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban, still less censorship.
Obama on Twitter Pledge Law in Support of Undocumented Students
& quot; If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act bill, then call your senators and push for the passage of this bill & quot;, tweeted the President of the United States on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today endorsed the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act law legalizing undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the Twitter social network.
& quot; If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act bill, then call your senators and push for passage of this bill & quot;, 'Obama tweeted.
His short message includes a cyberlink to a more comprehensive document, which invites the public to interact with their senators without delay, as the bill's vote is imminent.
& quot; With your voice, which we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you & quot;, he stresses.
The news was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block any vote for any bill except expanding Bush-era tax breaks and government funding.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the Dream Act bill's vote and other projects, such as the ratification of the New START treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
Asked about the Republicans' blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a schedule for the remaining projects could be set.
& quot; I think we have a lot of time left... & quot;
& quot; All of us agree that the tax issue must be settled before the end of the year... & quot;
& quot; I think we can make an agreement about this at any time and after that we can schedule the expiry of the rest & quot;, he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would request a vote on closing the & quot; debate, so that the Dream Act bill legalizing undocumented college students could pass the Senate as of next Thursday, though the House is more likely to pass next week.
The version of the Dream Act Act, or the Law of the American Dream, would legalize approximately 800,000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in this country for the last five years, and are enrolled in a higher education institution or in the Army.
But proponents of the bill need sixty votes to pass the initiative, so they depend on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intense lobbying operation on the adoption of the bill.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, hold 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the bill.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act must get several Republicans on their side in case other Democrats should choose to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most-courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who assumed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out in favor of the bill, John McCain, has not yet set out his stance.
Though the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
Using literature to put a finger in the wound
The second round of & apos; The Pleasure of Language & apos; was a stroll where the attendees pushed the narrative
& quot; The Sex in Language I understand, but... The Finger in the Wound? What is expected of me? & quot; asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela. She was going to open the second round of & apos; Los placeres de la lengua & apos;, a cycle celebrating Spanish-language literature and took this opportunity to use the subtitle of her question (at another event, she explained, the roundtable was devoted to Sex in Language).
The finger in the wound... & quot; gets us into trouble & quot; the Argentinian writer spat sweetly toward the audience consisting mainly of young people who came together at the Guadalajara International Book Fair (FIL) to attend this roundtable moderated by Marisol Shultz. Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read aloud a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio. Shultz thereafter marked it as a great narrative. Luisa tells in first person, and is the protagonist who is searching to find out what a & quot; wound is, and going from doctor to doctor, of which she does n 't get an answer, but she does get hints for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectologist convinced: patience is not my strength, maybe that is my wound. & quot;
To conclude, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, but who explains to her that wound is not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar. & quot;
The main character of the narrative sighs with relief, and closes that she only learned about the wound that it was really open, and that & quot; does not exist. But she is convinced that the pleasure of language and its traps intermingle.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called & apos; praise of the invention & apos;, and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but is discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he recounts a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back well-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative did a U-turn, reporting from America, the great novel that was not short of its own chronicler from the very start, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo criticizing the abundance of the stories told by the conquistres.
& quot; Cervantes, who invited us all (the writers), mocked the pretended witnesses that turned up in the stories presented as being true, but otherwise the history of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the sense of shame. & quot;
However, he highlights that it is the madmen and liars who can best imagine & quot; things, and that is where reality and falsehood approach each other, where you do n 't know which side the narrative belongs to, where fiction reaches its peak.
He actually calls this the & apos; Tradition Cervantes & apos;.
& quot; From it we have inherited to be what is narrated. & quot;
When it was the turn of Mayra Montero, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations that the FIL's invitation to the round table on & apos; The Finger in the Wound & apos; contributed to.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted her contribution to the great wound of the social violence that afflicts her country - like the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggles over drug trafficking.
& quot; I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned engagement & quot;, she explained, after having emphasized that literature is communication and liability that builds up between the author and the readers as in a & quot; chemical reaction & quot; has done.
The evening was ended by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution likewise highlighted the dedicated writer's finger in the wound of the writer' s & quot; hand.
He noted that in a fast-paced world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness amount to dogmatism, and is forgotten, & quot; that behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes. & quot;
& quot; To be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we have to nuance. And nuance often means putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable thinking in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in ready-made ideas without nuance, and also harassing those in power who prefer to divide the world into black and white, he observed, inviting them to rediscover the meaning of writing.
Romano fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the endgame, two different styles given by their respective coaches also face each other, and their encounter of opposites is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive matches, and so far he has kept up well, so this opportunity is of very particular importance to him.
The Argentinian has played himself up to the second champion with the medal, he is one step behind the winners and amazingly he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The anti-Semitic strategist reached the first final as coach of the & apos; Torneo Apertura in 2002. & apos; had the reins in his hand when del Morelia lost 4-2 to Toluca. Later, during the & apos; Clausura 2003 & apos; he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the & apos; Torneo Bicentenario 2010 & apos;, in which they played against Los Diablos), Rubén had to suffer a setback again, as the match ended in a tie with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play. But on the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two chances to collect his title. But in the end three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned to a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be haunted by unhappiness again and get rid of the evil spell to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
& quot; I want to be champion, I do not want to break any stats, this is for a club, for my affection I devote myself, and that is why the title will come to me, but what happens before that is the most important & quot;, the helmsman commented when asked about the lost finals.
The last endgame is still very much in his memory, he assures me that he learned a lot from it: & quot; The only lesson we can learn from this is that until the referee whistles the end, we cannot celebrate, we at the line are prepared, the players too, because last time we were already prepared to go out with two penalties, and I think this is a lesson until the game is not finished, there is no cause for celebration. & quot;
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts does not worry him, because he trusts his players. & quot; You never want to arrive at the shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it. We were prepared in the previous tour, but unfortunately fate made us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or a fierce desire to hold the title already in our hands. That left us something for this endgame, and we hope it will not come to this this this time.
It is in Romanso's power to stop being just the second champion and to savour the fame that titles bring for the first time.
The USA changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must introduce themselves before their conversation at the Consulate at the Visa Application Service Providers; costs are waiting times are thus shortened.
Starting January 10, 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa are changing at the United States Embassy and at the Consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the Visa Application Services (ASC, the first letters in English) before they enter the Consulate.
ASC staff picks up the applicant's biometric data, which is checked by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, these include:
The total cost of visa processing decreases, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately for the appointment arrangement, processing of the visa application, and the transportation service that handles the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the countervalue to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visa with application (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for hand and investor visas.
Those wishing to only renew their visa do not have to make conversation at the consulate. They only have to introduce themselves at the nearest ASC, where they will present their documentation and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment at the Consulate stay there for less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa at the Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey, and Nuevo Laredo consulates will no longer have to pay the $26 service charge.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure can be found at the following website: http: / / mexico.usembassy.gov / boletines / sp101201 _ Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the discovery of alien life
The North American Space Agency called a press conference to announce a discovery tomorrow that will have implications for the search for life in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) will announce an astrobiology discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The find will be presented at 1 p.m. tomorrow at a press conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. This is a science that investigates the origins, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In convening the press conference, NASA assured it would present to & quot; a startling discovery for the search for extraterrestrial life. This prompted speculation from experts in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments previously thought to be uninhabitable, human-like creatures may exist. The hypothesis has been raised that these could transform into intelligent creatures - just like humans - as their living conditions improve.
Seems to be a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that has been deemed to be too toxic to all conceivable life forms, as the lake is high in arsenic.
In some way, the microbiome uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this capability into account, the chances increase that there might be similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms exchange the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that there is actually another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know.
The space agency will announce the actual reach of its probe at its press conference tomorrow, on Thursday.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars. Biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), will be there to answer the question of whether its chemical composition is similar to Earth' s.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
The Congress reform bill introduces the two-party system, they complain.
The 60th legislature had just begun, and already an opposition bloc was installed, led by the PRD, PT, Convergencia, and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo. Introducing himself as an independent, the four questioned: the entry into the chamber of the & apos; bipartite system.
Before the start of the inauguration session into the 60th legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD, and Patrón Montalvo railed against the reform of the organ law, saying it would exclude them.
With this reform, they repeated, a & apos; two-party system would be introduced & apos; for now it would be two people, the same number as parties controlling the congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Bureau headed by the pan-anist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo declared that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally established their marginal political position with these reforms.
He said that in the next few days they would speak to the PAN and PRI representatives to change the scheme. They assumed that they had the political will, and if they did not, they would be subjugated by both parties again, putting an end to the opposition coalition.
& quot; This is where I come (the opposition coalition), this is what I see, because we are excluded from all the decisions that do not even care to consider the opinion of the others. & quot;
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia declared that there was agreement with PRD, PT and Patrón, and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, should now be a & quot; duopolistic & quot;.
& quot; It is not the spirit of legislative reform that a perpetual two-party system should prevail in Congress. & quot;
& quot; For the start this group will start with five deputies and they will talk to other colleagues so they will become more & quot;, the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to the PAN and PRI, stated that the Congress is currently turning into a & apos; loot & apos; for two.
& quot; Previously it was just one party, now they split these in twos. & quot;
Patrón Montalvo requested that deputies be respected and assigned their place at the negotiating tables.
& quot; It cannot be left out because of top decisions five, which will probably be nine deputies. The five, currently seen as divided into different factions, have chosen to unite to take our place at the bargaining table, because because of the reform that was done and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we do not agree with this reform. & quot;
200 000 Peso more for & quot; the supplier
Mazatlán municipal administration pays another check to the embattled owner of the electric equipment company.
Another check for little more than 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the municipal government.
This brings the total amount paid to the owner of the company for electrical equipment during the second half of the year to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the City Administration Transparency site, this cheque for an amount of 200,144,56 pesos was issued with the number 9258447 last November 16, with the purpose of invoicing open invoices.
The Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already forewarned that more money from the community would go to this vendor. She is watched by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at inflated prices.
What was not mentioned is the total amount you still owe her and, as a result, the number of cheques still being issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
& quot; Nothing was bought from her. It is simply the debts paid, just like with the other suppliers & quot;, he said in an interview.
The last checks & quot; received in & quot; last quarter of the year reappeared on & quot;: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and this last one of November 16.
Although the Supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law when a firm is challenged by ASE, in order to prevent other administrations from requesting their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the Noroeste newspaper published on July 25th the audit of cheques issued by the Municipal Administration to its suppliers, it became known that already earlier, from March 2008 to July 9th 2010, during Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez's three-year term of office, the municipality had paid Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques.
There were also transactions with Jumapam, where she collected cheques worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist Places Need Improvement
Tourist operators regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the bad condition of the Sánchez Taboada Glorieta in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the break-in of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourist industry of Mazatlán requested that the authorities pay special attention to areas that are in bad condition and have a bad image of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Distributors Association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on various occasions there were calls to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the roads and sidewalks had had a negative impact, as tourists would come for a stroll and see the clutter, whereupon they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
& quot; The politicians do not know what it means to have to close a company one day, and they do n 't worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise they would n' t do the building slowly and haphazardly in this way. & quot;
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall drew attention to the city' s lack of prevention and maintenance work.
& quot; The community must assume its responsibilities and avoid that something like this happens again. How should it do that? Well, patching up & quot; with preventive maintenance instead of with hindsight, he explained.
& quot; We are eagerly waiting to get a clean city. For it is not just because it is a tourist area that it has to be maintained, it is also us residents who have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration has to change its strategy in order to keep the city in good condition. & quot;
& quot; There are other places that also look unmaintained and unfinished & quot;, he said, & quot; for example el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán. & quot;
& quot; Nowadays, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It is necessary to offer a good product, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in check, & quot; added.
& quot; Not enough attention has been given to these precautions, and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to all: Maintenance is urgently needed.
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed how important it is to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they are not used properly and give a bad image.
He mentioned a number of places to be upgraded along with the city. Making the city clean, orderly and attractive to tourists should be a priority.
& quot; Fortunately, Mazatlán has many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive to tourism, and to add them to the inventory we use to promote this destination.
IP requesting results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, Chair of the CCE, suggested that deputies should take the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The Mazatlán business community is calling for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between parties and the government. Sinaloa is in turmoil and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60th Parliament was inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI deputies, 13 PAN deputies, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia, and one more from PVEM. This makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, feel indebted to society and the disparate social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism.
Eduardo Dávalos, Chair of the Business Coordination Council CCE, suggested that the new deputies should take the great responsibility of providing a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
& quot; We hope that the deputies will really be exercising their right to act freely of collusion between the parties, for it is common for them to make arrangements with which they represent their own interests, turning into carnival extras of the ruling party and the leaders of the parliamentary fractions. & quot;
He talked about that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
& quot; We are concerned that they are doing a trustworthy job and, above all, working for society and its groups, because it was the people of Sinaloa who gave them their vote of confidence in the last election. & quot;
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the hotel association Tres Islas, believes that one of the great challenges facing the 40 people's representatives is the drive and the working together for the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is extremely complicated.
& quot; The most important thing is that they will drive economic growth, stimulate investment and create infrastructure, which in some way will promote job creation. & quot;
With regard to the tourism industry, he asked the new MEPs to allocate the required place in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism.
& quot; I understood that it is the ministry with the second least resources. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment into the country and is in direct competition to the agro-industry.
Funds must be allocated to tourism projects, State security must be supported, and the Alcohol Act, which has not been revised in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Searching for Holy King
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are longing for children in the Coronado Valenzuela family.
It will be difficult for parents to fulfil these wishes on the next day of Epiphany, because the household is no longer and no less than twelve people and one kid.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar, and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing that they so crave.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende housing estate. They live hand to mouth, because the father has no steady job.
& quot; Sometimes hard times are called for because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the brats to the street to sell & quot;, said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a & apos; monster cart & apos; for some time now. For his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana suggests clothes the size for one-year-olds.
& quot; (José Alfredo) told me, & apos; I so much like this monster & apos;, but I replied to him, & apos; let's wait and see, boy & apos;, because it was very expensive & quot;, Cayetana remembered sadly.
For the older kids who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven year old María Guadalupe is size 12; ten year old Isaías is size 10, while eight year old Miguel is size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair of size 5 1 / 2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the & apos; Holy King Is Wanted Campaign & apos; by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the Noroeste newspaper.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday about ten house searches were carried out in the Estrie administrative region as part of the smashing of a network of cannabis production and sales.
Fourteen people were arrested at the time and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where most of the alleged drug-related incidents occurred.
& quot; About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash, and equipment used to produce it have been confiscated, said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
Eleven men and three women were arrested in total. Two of the men believed to be the main ringleaders of the drug ring are from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the Sherbrooke courthouse hours after they were arrested.
They could be charged, among other things, with producing cannabis, possessing it for sale, conspiring to commit and providing services to crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigation, which has been going on for over a year.
& quot; The information obtained from public hands has enabled us to make these arrests & quot;, specified M. Ruel.
About 70 officers from the Estria Regional Investigation Unit of the Quebec Security Police, Sherbrooke Police Department and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
The clandestine immigration could be easily tracked
The Conservative bill, which the government says is intended to regulate the problem of ships loaded with clandestine migrants, is likely to be stamped after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support the proposal.
& quot; I strongly oppose this charter. & quot;
& quot; I am holding with a party that has put shackles on your feet & quot;, said Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff to the assembled deputies after the end of the weekly caucus session.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows a person to be detained for up to one year by a sea vessel identified as transporting illegal immigrants, violates Canada's constitution of laws and freedoms, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Quebécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it would target the wrong target group.
& quot; We are against and it seems all opposition parties are against, so we will wait and see what the government will do & quot;, said M. Duceppe.
Criticism about Olivia Chow's, NDP' s, immigration question has deflected critics who claim their party is not steadfast enough on the home-grown-immigrants.
& quot; The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the stowaways, and that's what we are trying to push through by brokering another bill, the C-35, Chow said.
We therefore do not support the Conservative bill because it seeks to blame the refugees and keeps children imprisoned & quot; for at least one year, Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
& quot; The Canadians are emphatically telling the deputies that they do not tolerate this type of clandestine immigration, these criminal operations involving Canada and treating the country like a doorstep. & quot;
& quot; You expect Canada to take tough action & quot;, so Minister Kennedy responded.
& quot; The government has not announced any vote of confidence regarding its draft law, which could have led the country to elections that would have rejected the government.
A Conservative, however, has told the QMI agency that the Government would convene a vote so that any opposing MP would immediately declare himself or herself to his or her constituents.
The new unit does not find unanimity
Despite Jean Charest's announcement of the eventual creation of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this subject last January.
The metropolis has had a standing anti-corruption unit since 1870.
Nevertheless, Wednesday's announcement took more than one person by surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed in the slightest at the meeting of the Standing Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
There was also no denying that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Quebécois, qualified this announcement as a rabbit-hat-pulled & quot; and & quot ;-tinkered-out-of-the-hat & quot; solution at the end of the table.
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the unit in question, its future.
& quot; You will see the result when we announce it & quot;, he was content to affirm.
& quot; Man is aware of this problem. & quot;
According to Réjean Parent, president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public poll.
& quot; The more M. Charest persists in wanting to prevent the formation of this investigative committee, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide & quot;, he explained.
& quot; The only way to create an investigative committee is to resign Jean Charest & quot;, said Yves Boisvert, a professor of ethics and policy systems at ENA (the State College for the Training of Senior Administrators).
In order to break this impasse, he proposes to give Quebec financial audit control a special mandate so that it can investigate corruption and collusion properly.
& quot; One should be able to extend the audit control mandate, & quot; decided.
He also holds the view that the Quebec could grant the exam control the same power as commissioners, which would also allow it to bind people to testify.
Formating a standing entity is not the only project in Government Charest's drawer.
The Quebec will likewise require Ottawa to amend the penal code so as to be more attuned to this type of crime.
This request came from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice, Jean-Marc Fournier, that the jurisdiction in this type of prosecution is not unambiguous.
Vic Toews, State Minister of Public Security confirmed in turn that his colleague of the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which concerned motorcycle police teams, 131 people were arrested despite no amendment to the criminal code.
Ottawa, as a result, enforced the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers Under Strict Monitoring
Several river rivers remain under tight guard because of the heavy rainfall that has fallen in some areas of the province since Tuesday.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preemptively.
In the evening another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
One street collapsed in the process.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rain has fallen as much as 40 to 70 milliliters of precipitation on several regions.
Between 20 to 40 additional millimetres of precipitation was expected here, according to regions, by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
Up to 100 millimetres of rain had fallen here in total.
Because to these precipitation is added the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain subdivisions, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec security service issued flood warnings for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The river courses to the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains, and the Chêne in Lotbinière, become flood watches here, and they will continue to be monitored.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has caused flooding to some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a backup bridge was torn away because of heavy rain.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais crossing of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the parish of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, Security Council member Annik Bouchard said.
Quebec State High Water Center issued flood watches Wednesday for several rivers, especially Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Reprised Dupont Part
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before Canada's Broadcasting Standards Board (CCNR) for his controversial remarks about social welfare and Haitians, as well as his abusive use of radio.
The CCNR holds the view that while Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their own opinions, certain statements have included inaccurate information about social welfare, and unjustifiably negative representations of Haitians, as well as such uncouth language that is not appropriate for daytime broadcasts.
The Board also concluded that a discussion of suicide, which involves spreading the names of two people who commit suicide, violates the Broadcasting Code.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the programmes aired during the 2008 and 2010 period.
The first order was filed following a complaint from the & quot; Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Quebec & quot;.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the shipment were inaccurate.
Moderators should give solid rather than misleading information.
Regarding the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had expressed the opinion that suicide is an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the board members had reached the conclusion that the message being conveyed here was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
& quot; The majority of the supervisory board takes into account that the consequences in question of the transmission of the & quot; Dupont le midi & quot; would have touched upon a sensitive subject in a family-friendly and appropriate manner. & quot;
As a result, he has been given no reprimand whatsoever against himself.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had engaged in a media-driven dispute over this, which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he did not donate to the Haiti Relief Fund because he did not know with certainty that the needy would actually receive the money donations.
The Board of Directors is of the opinion that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presents an unjustifiably negative representation of Haitians.
& quot; I have already served my three-day suspension sentence on this. & quot;
& quot; My file has been virgin & quot; for one and a half years, the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the supervisory board denounces the dissemination of an uncouth manner of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM radio announcer has acted beyond his obligations & quot;.
The consequences for the broadcaster, who, among other things, should have made his decisions known once during prime-time within a period of three days, are negligible.
King of kung-fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal-Algerian origin, has embarked on a very special course.
The athlete who excels in & quot; Sanda & quot; (full-contact kung-fu), kickboxing as well as thai boxing now climbs onto the tatami and the boxing rings of the world in search of new challenges.
& quot; I started martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago, & quot; explained Zemmal. Having resided in the metropolis since 2008, Zemmal wanted to further develop himself among the pros.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do n 't like the kind of ground fighting presented by the Mixed Martial Arts, contests in North America are rare. & quot;
Recently, the security officer and UPS employee had given his rival some bad news, in which he won two gold medals from the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the World Amateur Amateur Championship held in Edinburgh, Scotland between 23 and 30 October.
& quot; I won the full-contact kickboxing and thai boxing categories & quot;, 'he explained.
& quot; Currently, I am preparing for the World Cup in San Shou, China. & quot;
& quot; Those combatants from each category had been invited who had placed in the top four at the last World Championship. & quot;
& quot; I babe 2009 in Toronto Bronze fetched. & quot;
& quot; 2005 I came 8th in Vietnam.
& quot; 2007 I finished the tournament in China in fifth place, while in 2009 I finished third in Toronto, & quot; added.
& quot; It is worth noting that I have progressed every time I run. & quot;
& quot; With this rhythm I will be first this time or next year! & quot;
& quot; San Shou & quot; or & quot; Sanda; are disciplines that originate from China, where punches and kicks are allowed, as well as floor throws.
The duels usually take place on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxer to emerge from this type of combat sport is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal were to retain only one event in his career, he would surely call here his presence at the Super-tournament & quot; King of Sanda & quot;, the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
& quot; This contest is the highest ranking and most respected & quot; in China, explained the likeable Pfundskerl.
& quot; It is a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). & quot;
& quot; That was a super experience.
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-final of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
& quot; The one who beat me was a real pro & quot;, so he analyzed.
& quot; There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg). & quot;
& quot; The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the final of their category. & quot;
& quot; Then the winners of each category face off to crown a single champion, the King of Kung-Fu. & quot;
450 Million in Non-Tendering Contracts
Hydro-Quebec has, by mutual agreement, granted project designers $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert Hydro project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, for a sum of USD 295 million without a tender.
This consortium, called the & quot; Énergy gérance & quot;, was formed in 2004 as a concomitant to Hydro-Quebec's decision to commit to the private sector of its responsibility for this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the & quot; Énergy & quot; consortium won the lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem, raising the risk of competitive squeezing as well as a rise in prices.
& quot; This is a new way of playing a configured game and defends the competition. & quot;
& quot; This means that instead of mapped games, instead of using secret methods, you now run & quot; in open form, said Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, at the press conference yesterday.
Simard had raised the question in front of the National Assembly in the early morning, because he finds it hard to understand how the public interest could be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded to this in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract had been a set-up game.
& quot; I remain true to my line & quot;, she railed, asserting that the PQ had proceeded unfairly to & quot;, and that & quot; lacks hardness to & quot;.
She said it was the'very least' & quot; for the PQ to apologize.
The consortium model is standard practice worldwide.
It is usually a time limited alliance allowing two or more companies to pool their expertise regarding a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project & quot; Eastmain & quot; has a high level of complexity in terms of its scope of work.
The construction process is underway and is scheduled to be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without any possibility of competition; there had already been negotiation.
Moreover, even with relatively simple projects, the Consortium model in Quebec is no longer an exception.
As the newspaper & quot; Le Devoir & quot; noted last week, the model of the consortium used in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigation.
A brief flyover of the Quebec Business Register allows more than 200 consortia to be named, some of which appear to be of durable duration.
This is how, for example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any linkage, and there are several dozen of them, traces back to one and the same legal entity, namely Dessau.
With regard to the Consortium of Quot; Énergy Gérance & quot;, Minister Normandeau emphasized that the territory of the Baie James is subject to a particular labor dynamics, and that Hydro-Quebec has paid special attention to this fact since the 1970s.
Réal Laporte, the major employer of the Société d'apos; énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), issued a statement that made its nose rump over the fact that the project management contract was approved by agreement.
& quot; If you make a call for tender and there are only a few applicants, your prizes will skyrocket. & quot;
& quot; So you have two possibilities: either you take the people that are on this Mart and tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory deal at a good price. & quot;
& quot; however, the idea is that it is not the price that is decisive, it is the expertise of the people, & quot; reiterated Laporte.
This contract granted to the & quot; Énergy gérance & quot; consortium is part of a long list of contracts covering more than 50,000 dollars received from the Partébécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper counted & quot; Le Devoir & quot; more than 100 engineering and consultancy contracts granted to companies or their subsidiaries, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, Génivar got 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10 without counting their participation in & quot; Énergie gérance & quot;.
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
You total $449 783 344, including the contract with & quot; Énergie gérance & quot; $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the & quot; Parti libéral du Quebec are well known & quot;.
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally connected to the companies that she funded & quot; quot;, before specifying that it was more about its executives.
Barometer Responsible Consumption - The & quot; Green & quot; Label Is Not Confidential
Green but outright sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the major players of sustainable growth, but neither do the labeled brands or the eco labels that are supposed to guide his or her choice.
Pity, though it bathes in a media-savvy universe teeming with information in favor of more responsible consumption: the responsible consumption barometer has a lack of credible information to complain about, an inadequacy that turns itself out to be a brake on its engagement, as the first reading held yesterday showed.
Although they advanced consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebeckers still seem to have little credit for those who try to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population admits to not really believing in companies' environmental commitment any more than they do green corporate advertising, according to the measurement instrument elaborated by the responsible consumer center at Sherbrooke University.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that declare themselves environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
In the same pattern, politicians' discourse on this subject is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
The information regarding responsible consumption seems nonetheless important for stimulating this consumer segment, which is currently populated by approximately only one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, emptiness and the dubious nature of information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebeckers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to get hold of.
According to another communication, more than half of the consumers had already changed their habits in 2010, and predominantly changed the brand of one or more products in order to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, 61% of them had preferred shopping at their district's merchants and favored buying food grown in their region.
Greener and Responsible - the eco-conscious consumption index had reached a 64 of the maximum score of 100 this year - the Homo consuus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce the traces left in the environment by being concerned about animal welfare.
However, the social and environmental consciousness still seems to stop in front of its car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebeckers reported to have used public transportation in 2010, or to have preferred the ride-sharing center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
Walking as well as riding a bicycle were also approved by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behavior survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Bondholder for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which has been invited by Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer Angus, together with the company Parallèle, who had hoped to receive a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to acquire the eXcentris cinema complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent, belonging to Daniel Langlois. They apparently do n 't get what they are asking.
The government accepted to get involved, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is offering a loan of less than the initial hoped-for amount, which could create an existence-able solution on favorable terms, at least according to the opinion of sources extracted from the State Rumor Kitchen.
An initial action plan as well as a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring. The request has since been recalculated downwards again.
A proposal together with a plan of action has already been sent by the President of the & quot; Société de développement des entreprises culturelles & quot; (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre. She will head the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her a last factual report.
However, the cabinet counter proposal was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31 December to reply to this one.
In any case, the premise of the state donation really seems to have been pushed aside.
Let's recall that the Quebec owner' s community of cinemas and movie complexes rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the eXcentris acquisition, arguing that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance to provide for real estate projects there that he did not give to other movie theaters as well.
However, several other market participants in the segment filed for substantial, economic assistance in contrast.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, Daniel Langlois, director of the cinema, had presented the auteur's cinema at the premises of his complex with great difficulty for more than ten years. This could justify the exceptional position on the part of the treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than evident in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep its clientele at the bar.
Société Angus, as well as the company Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are heading for a privately-financed campaign, which they hope will raise $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one screen continues to show movies in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the prospective purchaser is to re-open the three cinemas on 27 February next year, with a screening of Xavier Beauvois' very successful film, & quot; Des hommes et des dieux & quot;.
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not remove the newspaper & quot; Le Devoir & quot;, and one ignores what he and his group think of the downward-rectified suggestions made to them.
Mystery of complex-shaken Canada revealed
The new American diplomatic channels spread through WikiLeaks unravel the mystery of what the United Nations, under the inferiority complex of Canadians, considers to be inferior to the Americans; but they reveal at the same stroke the superiority of the latter over Canada.
Consequently, American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does n 't have Canada-America relations in mind when voting begins, and they believe that President Obama' s visit would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were circulated publicly yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content to nibble at.
A liaison dating from 22 September 2008, that is, the period in which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political chiefs.
Much to the astonishment of David Wilkins, the American Ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr. Wilkins offers various ways of explaining this situation.
& quot; A near-intrinsic inferiority complex among Canadians is probably what causes Canadian political leaders to talk about the inner issues of everyday life much more than passing the buck to the United States in this election (as they did with the Free Trade Campaign in 1988), & quot; is how he describes & quot;.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus & quot;'s proverbial Goliath: omnipresent, but potentially too menacing, to speak of him.
The Ambassador understands this & quot; deafening silence & quot; all the less because the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
& quot; Logically, & quot; so he assesses, & quot; should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has in mind as a key factor in the ballot. & quot;
The other expression of this sense of importance reads in the message sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Charge in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
& quot; Your Journey will help to ensure the government's survival in the confidence vote on the federal budget early February, when Canada will announce its first deficit in more than a decade, created by a $30 to $40 billion stimulus program, & quot; writes.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent the parliament being overthrown by the coalition and the so-conditioned persistence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed invigoration program.
Another message, dated January 2008, and written by Ambassador Wilkins, notifies Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series aired on CBC are spreading from the United States.
The Ambassador is concerned about programs like Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O in which you can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the & quot; No-Fly-List & quot;, or even diversions for the purposes of CIA-led interrogations.
Again another message reports at length about how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at their first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual & quot; case-to-case & quot; decision.
At the end of the meeting, & quot; described as having given the secretary of state a piece of paper regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin.
& quot; The Secretary of State has agreed to re-view the file & quot;.
Let's finally note that tempers are heating up regarding the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had declared via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be killed.
He had referred here to Mike Huckabee of the United States.
Worldwide Lighting Renewal Plan
The UN proposed yesterday in Cancun a plan to renew lighting for homes, trade and industry in 100 countries, with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (CFC) equivalent to nearly one third of the additional reduction that will have to be realized to stabilize Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its place in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun, to compensate for the absence of industrialized countries' mandatory reduction commitments.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem, in the form of 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of CFC emitted to the Earth as a result of lighting, would be avoided if the white-hot bulbs, which so far represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent, or better yet, light-emitting diodes (LED).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world's emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the exhaust gases in the world fleet.
In Copenhagen last year major exhaust emitters like the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans. These were to reduce global CFC emissions from 53Gt to 49Gt.
However, one would have to deduct another 5Gt from this balance in order to stabilize the 2 degree Celsius climate increase from today until 2020, in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-light bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, with the remaining 5% producing the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%. With the new LED bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced twice as much.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last on average 6000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by Philips this week - this company, by the way, participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25.000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-light bulb. This gives an intimation of the savings possibilities of the replacement plan to be applied in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that these completely new light bulbs emit very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent bulbs have reserves as they contain mercury, and that it is therefore necessary to dispose of them as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless producers provide an acceptance point.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal power plants, which emit much more mercury to produce the electricity wasted by the incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details in detail the profits each country would generate thanks to this international program.
In this way, for example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year buying electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power stations that Indonesia would cost $2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has demanded the & quot; immediate release of the results of Ivory Coast's presidential election immediately after its deadline expires.
& quot; The Secretary-General underscores the need for the Independent Election Commission to preserve its work and announce the preliminary results without further delay, & quot; emphasized a spokesman for the U.N. chief.
& quot; He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and abstain from any initiative until the promulgation of the preliminary results.
In spite of the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the election commission had let the deadline, set at midnight Wednesday, elapse three days after the election on Sunday without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the commission would continue with & quot; work to announce the results.
On Wednesday, there were numerous calls from around the world for the CEI to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round of voting, under the leadership of the retiring Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent, Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp is counting on the Constitutional Council to annul & quot; fraudulent & quot; ballots in the north obtained during the failed September 2002 coup by the ex-rebel camp of the nouvelles forces (FN).
Pascal Affi N & apos; Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, confirmed that the FN's tactics of intimidating voters in the north of the country had deterred the president' s supporters from voting.
The entire election could be canceled if Gbagbo's complaints are upheld by the Constitutional Council.
The Gbagbo opponents, however, are now more of the opinion that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N & apos; Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the north, denying any connection to the ex-rebels. He described the delay in announcing the election results as a & quot; unacceptable & quot; and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he did not go as far as to claim victory.
His allies assert that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he 'lost; and making a complaint to the Constitutional Court after preventing the electoral commission from publishing the results is illegal.
Sunday's second round of presidential elections were billed as the coronation of the process of unification and reconciliation in a country that has been divided into two for years.
On Wednesday the United Nations had warned the politicians of the Ivory Coast that they could be held responsible in case of eventual riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had won the first round of voting on October 31 with 38% of the vote, compared to the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who had the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round) as a front-runner.
Unemployment rate in France stable in third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is at a stable 9.3% in the metropolis, as defined by the International Labor Office (IAA), the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office of Insee show.
The jobless figure in the metropolis is 2.631 million.
The second quarter data was 9.3% of the metropolis' working-age population, and 9.7% when the overseas departments are included.
Over the year, the unemployment rate recorded a rise of 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million workers in the French capital were not employed in the third quarter, but they nevertheless wanted to find a job, including whether or not they were available for employment every two weeks, and whether or not they were job-seeking.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, + 0.5 percentage points seen over the year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 youths aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have recorded a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+ 0.2 percentage points seen over three months and over the year), that is, 482 000 people over the age of 50, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only those aged 25-49 had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, + 0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After an argument about its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method, announcing on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) versus 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a waste disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) Region, is under investigation. He is currently being held in prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into the public markets suspected of fraud.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzlement of company assets, embezzlement of public goods, theft, complicity in corruption, unauthorized bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
& quot; Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight, and intends to speak out on any questions the prosecutor will ask him, instead of spinning fantasies. & quot;
& quot; It is easy to accuse him of a series of criminal charges, another thing is to prove & quot;, his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) ahead of his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had made a point of sending the judge a memo to justify himself before his hearing through his lawyers.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday evening.
According to attorney Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to manage, running.
He would never have had knowledge of the business jurisdiction or the destination location of the associated funds, Simon said.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Agglomerate, was also indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then released on condition that he stay away from the protagonists of these acts under court supervision.
& quot; My client was able to provide explanations to the facts that he was accused of.
& quot; The lead prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, his lawyer Yann Arnoux said.
Four other people were charged and released from custody Tuesday night, including two of them under judicial supervision, said Deputy Chief Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposal company, is being prosecuted for unauthorised influencing and passive bribery.
Two state officials from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested. One was charged with conspiring to defraud and embezzlement of public property by a public servant, and the other with conspiring to embezzle public funds.
Also Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of & quot; stealing and embezzlement of social assets & quot;
Among the people who have been confronted by Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar public-sector affair involving Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of helping to launder money originating from & quot; high-level & quot; criminal circles.
The investigation of X for alleged fraud in the awarding of public contracts, here especially in the Disposal Branch, is conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigation procedures.
Sources close to the investigation indicate that the investigation is particularly focused on the terms of the contract and the operation of a landfill site in La Ciotat, which also deals with waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain Marseille urban catchment area cities (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher detained in Iran for & quot; espionage, kept the French public on tenterhooks, setting diplomacy on alert and accentuating the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and viewed by the & quot; Le Monde newspaper reveal some of the backgrounds of this crisis.
You describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, who went as far as to give them advice on dealing with their own crisis of & quot; taking & quot; hostages in Iran (a small group of walkers).
You point out how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that freeing the young Frenchwoman does not mean the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian imprisoned in France and sought by the American judiciary for trading material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a garish light the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media, for the purpose of giving them credibility to the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in freeing Clotilde Reiss.
In fact, he had done nothing about it.
A diplomat telegram edited on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled & quot; Iran: French Comments on the way to handle hostage-taking & quot;.
François Richier, Elysée advisor on strategic issues, chatted with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d 'apos; Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
You explained the French method to her.
The advised the Americans to do all they can to repatriate their own nationals who are being held violently in Iran.
& quot; Makes noise & quot;, they said, & quot; articulates loud and clear and without ceasing & quot; the words & quot; basic human rights & quot;, & quot; innocence & quot;, & quot; immediate release & quot; in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which is very sensitive to its image.
& quot; Does this all the more, especially since the Iranians are asking you not to do the & quot;.
For & quot; silence solves nothing & quot; past the discussion attempts about unobtrusively, the Iranians are & quot; masters in evasive maneuvers & quot;.
Mr. Richier adds that arresting foreigners is a & quot; common Iranian tactic. & quot; takes hostages for the purpose of political blackmail.
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due to take place on August 16th, the day she fled to the French Embassy) requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians.
And he announces that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that & quot; will aggravate.
The Iranians could arrest & quot; another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in & quot; Iran in the near future, he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but she is still being held in Iran.
One piece of information was circulated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is requesting on charges of illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, was released from custody after a judge in Paris decided.
The American Embassy, like numerous other observers, faces questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which has been tracking Iran's illicit networks of acquisition of material destined for its nuclear program.
Has France accepted horse-trading?
Liberating the Iranian vs. the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of another meeting with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assures us that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only completely surprised by the judge's decision, but also tried to rebel against it.
& quot; There has been a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice & quot; (currently Michèle. Alliot-Marie), but & quot; the French Government cannot change the judicial decision & quot;, he explains.
Mr. Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to operate under the strict & quot; supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée advisor dials a telephone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in & quot; in the Iranian Embassy-run buildings in Paris.
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is not sparing its efforts to make people believe that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad is playing a major role in the & quot; and & quot; influential middleman role, using pronouncements and media-organized & quot; attempts to escape.
The Americans are not observing this activity without irony, noting that the manipulation bears fruit, since several press articles mirror the official French version.
A telegram dated August 25, 2009 conjures up the media blitz of the French authorities on & quot;.
What is it that is based on so much & quot; thanksgiving & quot; to Mr. Assad, the Paris embassy wonders.
& quot; Despite their declarations full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did & quot;.
The document then deals with the reasons that have led the Elysée to succumb to this fiction.
The intensive communication effort & quot; aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria, & quot; he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008 that was then regarded as premature and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad.
Building up the Syrian role, & quot; tries to make Paris; & quot; show Syria what rewards can be obtained by playing a constructive role in the region.
The goal is also to sow & quot; discord between Syria and Iran.
The American Embassy knows this from good source.
On August 11, François Richier had confided to her: & quot; of course we do not know if the Syrians did whatever & quot;.
& quot; But we thanked them in spite of everything. & quot;
& quot; This should at least create confusion with the Iranians. & quot;
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their & quot; active role in securing the release of our fellow countrymen.
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called the & quot; Cinderella, which will prohibit teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have hinted.
A bill to require online gaming operators to deny access to these games to young people under the age of 16 after midnight will be introduced to parliament in December, Education and Family Ministry representatives said.
& quot; Many kids play these games all night long and then have trouble with learning at school and also living a normal life during the day. & quot;
& quot; We are of the opinion that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep & quot;, said Jo Rin. Ministerial Commissar in charge of this draft law, the French press agency Agence France Presse.
The online games will be accessible again from 6 o 'clock in the morning after that.
The vendor companies would have a year to prepare themselves for the application of the law, he specified.
The government will also consider asking the manufacturers to scale down the daily time limit for accessing these games for those young people whose parents ask for it, the official added.
He will also make free programs available to people who wish to so, allowing them to limit the amount of time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most & quot; networked & quot; countries. Newspapers regularly report various events related to Internet usage.
The country is also the undisputed champion in global online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals against 58 other nations in the World Cyber Games.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoint the host country
In a flurry of excitement over suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday named the 2018 and 2022 World Cup hosts, a highly political election in which wrangling for influence, as well as lobbying, threatens to eclipse the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA's premier event will be held in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to gain new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent première, or to continue its presence in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Head of Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the behind-the-scenes machinations are threatening to stop right to the last minute.
Difficult otherwise to establish a candidate hierarchy.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018), and American (2022) files provide better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be as weighty for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at election time.
The Sunday Times, which was at the start of the revelations with the suspension of two members of the executive committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as easily have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which has hosted the World Cup only once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had given it new life on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that blasted three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English officials who, in the first instance, had lobbied David Cameron intensively in these last few weeks.
The PM hopes to recreate the kind of move achieved by his predecessor Tony Blair, who was in charge of organising the London 2012 Olympics.
Would this intense effort be enough to reclaim England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo is not short of assets with its already completed stadiums, its expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the two countries' economic and financial downsides could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia becoming a heavyweight outsider, despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has, however, decided to make the blunt allusion to the allegations of the English press denouncing & quot; as unfair competition in the preparation of the & quot; vote by the committee members.
& quot; You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them & quot;, 'Putin railed.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorite.
First economic world power, home of the major FIFA sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that helped to organize the 2002 Games.
Another threat: FIFA's eagerly awaited 2026 World Cup approval for China, rendering Asia' s chances of 2022 dead in the water.
With Australia and Qatar pulling out all the stops as futuristic stadiums are built, FIFA is tracking their expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights accredited by European countries (due to time lag), FIFA's touchy-feely nerve.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really trimmed down.
Mitterand had made believe that he was falling.
Valéry Giscard d & apos; Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
One mandate in the Elysée invokes the next.
The current leader ergo will be a candidate in 2012.
But the clarity is not good on the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend to be in doubt from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, supporters of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate could not be ruled out without believing in themselves.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy, in a serious tone assured & quot; that he would make his decision sometime in the fall of 2011.
The fact that on Tuesday evening, in front of the UMP parliamentarians at the Elysée, he would let the prospect of & quot; winning two seats sound a little feverish.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he has mentioned the presidential election on such occasions in a humorous tone.
& quot; You have at worst another seven and a half years with me, or at best & quot;, & he; explained to them in July 2009.
On a new thing in May 2010: & quot; Doesn 't think I' t think about the phase after that. & quot;
His words of the day before yesterday do not make him any more a candidate than the day before; but neither does they make him any less.
If they should elicit comments, then for two reasons.
The acceleration of the candidacy race with the PS on one side.
It is not, however, the taking up of the contest with Ségolène Royal that prompts Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is its apparent candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS exhort to challenge earlier than assumed.
The bad polls on the other hand.
For the first time, voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% to 44%, according to the BVA-L & apos; Express poll).
& quot; We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about & quot; reacting immediately and cautiously the environment of the prime minister.
& quot; If he would find defeat as possible, he would n 't be candidate & quot;, says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
& quot; He will always believe in being able to win & quot; corrects Alain. Juppé has resigned himself to the fact that it is obvious.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB Governing Council last year was supposed to be an opportunity to show ways to exit the crisis, or at least to announce the ordering of a large number of monetary policy unconventional measures, to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the Central Bank in Frankfurt certainly cannot afford to forfeit even today's more than tense situation on the european bond markets, so as not to cause its deterioration.
The political cost would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, at a press conference yesterday, hailed the ECB's active role in solving Europe' s sovereign debt problem.
It did not dare to say whether it believed that the Central Bank could do more, for example by boosting its sovereign bond buying program.
& quot; I reserve my recitals for my European trading partners (...) & quot;
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not been very eloquent about his projects the previous day in Brussels, at his hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee. He was rather content to point out that the program of buying government securities on the & quot; secondary market would continue and that we will see & quot; at the meeting on Thursday what the decisions are & quot; will be.
Only certainty: the ECB will leave its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the treasury's bond purchases were doubled last week by the ECB to approximately 1.35 billion euros.
And according to some traders' indiscretions, yesterday she was reported to have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese government securities.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have made purchases of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among traders, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is in no way contested (see page 29).
The economists do not expect a notable change in the price anymore.
When the three-month-plus bond deals will have already gone from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still be fretting over the unfettered cash reserves in a generous way, for a period from one week to three months.
Economists are already assuming that this measure will extend for a few more months.
& quot; I cannot imagine that the ECB will modify its program in a substantial way. & quot;
& quot; Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term, & quot;, suggests Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
& quot; A progressive exit scheduled for the first quarter of 2011 seems to me more likely & quot;, for its part, anticipates Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the sovereign debt market, the ECB should maintain such a volume of bond purchases, which would stimulate the sluggish market, adds Norbert Bräms.
Considering the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of sovereign debt in the eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
& quot; You must step up to the debtors of deficient investors in the market at any price and act in such a way to prevent the rash enthusiasm over the yields paid to the weakest sovereigns & quot; has witnessed yesterday, a major bond holder.
Because if interest rates start to soar, governments would be even more prevented from reducing, or even stabilizing, their indebtedness.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After an alarming start to the week for Italy, things eased a bit yesterday with the fall of the benchmark interest rate to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
By the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economy, the Regional President Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as a & quot; indecipherable & quot;, and heard him calculate with a & quot; unpredictable & quot; weekend. However, the person in question immediately denied this.
Anyway, on Tuesday, the German interest rate shear would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of contracts covering the risk of default would have risen to 263 points. This had caused a certain amount of headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy with German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as a & quot; deeply worried about the & quot; market turmoil and possible contagion from Ireland.
& quot; The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland. & quot;
& quot; The bad news is that Italy, like Portugal is & quot;, explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain English, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying, dwindling, tax revenues that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Going forward, Italian growth is expected to reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget currently under scrutiny by the Senate is expected to reach 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, next year's budget deficit will still amount to 4.3% of GDP (against the 3.9% predicted by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the furor surrounding a new budgetary collective, which could be put to a sum of 7 billion euros after the holidays.
& quot; If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken & quot;, says Auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is getting support from international institutions.
& quot; The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are in order, we have been repeating & quot; for a long time now, assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund entrusted to Italy at the IMF.
& quot; At the moment there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, because, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.R.R.), Italy is being asked for less stabilization progress than other countries. & quot; observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
Remains the question of political unsteadiness.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organized as early as the end of March.
So there is an unfavourable period ahead for decision-making with regard to a severe crisis.
Europeans reflect on expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had made it explicit as late as yesterday, in the context of a press conference in Paris: & quot; I think you proved it on Sunday afternoon as well as in the evening: the Europeans are clearly sticking together, are ready and committed to defend their currency as well as their currency area & quot;.
Although perfectly relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rate feet of the european sovereign bonds was water on the grinders of governments as well as ECB.
Normalization can 't yet be started, however.
The rating agency Standard & amp; Poor & apos; s had said it could downgrade Portugal's debt rating, arguably the most effective target of speculators today.
& quot; As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and policy visibility weighing heavily on banking systems, according to economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially as the political time is much slower for & quot; than it is for the markets.
The European countries, well aware of both the gulf and the danger it represents, are intensifying discussions on strengthening existing anti-crisis measures.
Informal consultations are progressing well between the Finance Ministers most directly affected, and more broadly with their counterparts at the G20.
And this also in view of the Eurogroupe and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the plan, the fate of the unconventional measures to bolster the backs of eurozone countries is in the markets' crosshairs (see below).
Regarding the EU stability funds, their Executive Director Klaus Regling started his Asia tour already on Tuesday in Singapour to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he is certainly preparing the ground for it.
The first paper issues from the EU stability fund are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an American official told Reuters the United States supported a possible increase in the IMF-mobilized fund because of the IMF's additional direct involvement.
For their part, Portugal and Spain, the countries in the front row, are gearing up to adopt structural reforms, especially in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms to add to the austerity measures, but supposed to have effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland did.
Either one or the other, it is to be avoided at all costs to have to ask for international help before they have set their own budgetary adjustments and have decided upon unavoidable structural reforms that will bring back their confidence in the long run.
European creditors, in turn, talk about the options available to accelerate the normalization process of sovereign bond's markets.
Axel Weber, passing through Paris on 24 November, was the first to suggest that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to pocketbook again.
The economists at Barclays Capital, the most prominent player in the market for European sovereign debt, consider that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, preferably & quot; in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This means exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilization, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
An Advisory Board which has every chance of being carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are tightening up.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert level
The Snow episodes still cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary networks of Brittany and are threatening to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four Departments is now at alert level Orange due to the looming risk of snow and ice.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already at alert level Orange; 18 since Wednesday's afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde; then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of Gironde as well as the Charentes, it is snowing easily on the et Ile-de-France
Snow is expected in the affected departments from 2 to 5 cm, in places also 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even as far as 5 cm in the Parisian region.
Affected regions are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Lower-Normandy, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfalls are considerable enough to cause traffic disruption and disrupt certain economic activities, predicts Météo France.
In the Côtes d '& apos; Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
The traffic situation on the secondary networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic policemen, who advise against using your own vehicle only in case of an emergency. The use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was canceled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were foreseen for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The Prefecture of & quot; urges motorists to take maximum care on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly. & quot;
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris' Roissy airport and 10% of those departing from Orly on Thursday due to the expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends to air passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in south London, as well as Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Raining Billions Since the Transport Modernization Debate is in Full Swing on the Ile-de-France
At least in the discussions.
Recall in particular the 23 billion for the Grand Paris metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of SGP, the state has declared a capital envelope of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend a part of the sum of finance in the markets at twice their value.
Today, finally, some initial extrapolations have been made.
The 2010 supplementary budget, approved this morning by the National Assembly Finance Commission, contains the measures intended to raise the first portion of that money.
These are two types of measures: creating a special tax for exploration and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de-France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes & quot; in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris.
This is quantified: & quot; The product of this tax is 117 million euro per year.
The second is a reordering of the already existing company taxation: & quot; to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it, and to entrust this increase to the Société du Grand Paris.
How much would this bring in?
A puzzle.
This sum is not quantified in the text.
You are far from the 4 billion.
& quot; It is stated that tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of capital envelope raised by the state, and that according to the Société du Grand Paris, the money is gradually taken from the project, according to the explanatory statement.
In SGP you do not find this system offensive at all.
& quot; From the moment you enter receipts (the two taxes, i. e. R.), you can cover the project for three years and then only then draw on the 4 billion, & quot; is explained.
& quot; This will be noted in the budget and subtracted & quot; step by step.
The SGP estimates that in 2013 it will begin to write down the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 billion promised can still be sought for a long time, runs the risk of provoking a quite eventful parliamentary discussion.
The first public session takes place on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks Affair has two meanings.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is only a scandal in Sinner Hypocrisy, which governs the relationship between the states, the citizens, and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at an international level, and gives a foretaste of the regression-dominated future.
But let us go ahead by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that any intelligence service file (of any nation) is composed exclusively of newspaper cuttings.
The & quot; extraordinary & quot; American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw up nothing more than what one could read for months anyway in any journal (except those owned by Berlusconi), and Gadhafi' s alarmingly caricatured profile provided cabaret artists with material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule according to which the secret dossiers may consist only of news already known is essential for the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
When you go into a library dedicated to esotherical publications, you will realize that each work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Cross of the Roses) exactly repeats what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish any research (yet because he does not know where to find news about the non-existing), but because those who are dedicated to occult texts believe in nothing other than what they already know and what they have already learned.
This is also the Dan Brown success mechanism.
Likewise the secret file.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited-minded) is also the chief of intelligence (otherwise, he could be whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only considers as true what he acknowledges.
The top-secret information about Berlusconi that the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why has there been such fuss about the disclosures of these dossiers?
On one page, these state what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of World War II and since then also the Heads of Government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few minor representation tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore this.
Nevertheless: the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place, the idea that an x-factor hacker can tap the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world carries the considerable blow to the prestige of the state department.
What's more, the scandal is less about the victims and more about the & quot; executioner & quot;.
But let us be concerned with the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's day, all power could be concentrated like a Big Brother controlling every gesture of its subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly accurate since then, where you could control every move thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel you visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
If, however, one considers what is happening today that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape a hacker's control, then the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's Avenger - can discover the secrets of power.
How, however, can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets hold?
It's true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of Berlusconi' s or Merkel's character is basically a secret free of secrets, since it exposes the public sphere; but to reveal, in the style of WikiLeaks, that Hillary Clinton' s secrets were empty secrets is to strip them of any power.
WikiLeaks did not wrong Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama did.
What will the consequences of this insult inflicted upon such a mighty power be?
It is obvious that states will not put any reserved information online any more in the future - that would be tantamount to a notice being stuck on the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies it is futile to hope to be able to keep confidential reports about telephone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a leader of state has moved away in an airplane and contacted one of his or her colleagues.
How could we maintain private and only-certain-ears-only relationships in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romanticism, but I feel compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in a secret manner diligently on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their messages nowhere else but in the bare memory, and furthermore hiding the little written information they got in the shoe sales.
The information would be stored in a single copy in locked drawers: basically, the Watergate espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that today, technology is advancing like a cancer, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegrapher revolutionized communication, the Internet is reconstructing a telegrapher with (telephone) wire.
The (analog) videocassettes had enabled the filmmakers to scout a film tape by tape, by allowing one to spool from back to front and reveal all the secrets of the montage, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, in macro proportions.
High-speed trains take three hours to travel from Rome to Milan, whereas flying requires three-and-a-half hours including the transfer.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to the car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times the press tried to understand what kind of secrets were forged between the embassies.
Currently, it's the embassies demanding confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France whitewashes its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen accord, it is time to investigate the fulfilment of the fast-solved financing promises (also called the & quot; Fast Start & quot; or premature financing) realized by developing countries.
And already the rough French goodies have been revealed.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries committed to allocate 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has pledged €7.2 billion over three years. France has pledged €1.26 billion (or €420 million per year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fast-start funding: detailed procedure report of its member states, press conference, big side events, brochure distribution.
The Transparency operation is noteworthy, and grade prized for its real value: the developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries doing the same on the same precision level.
The EU announces to have released 2.2 billion Euros in 2010, which puts it on the right track to repay its commitment of 7.2 billion Euros in 2012.
But if you look at the detail, things are a little bit more complicated.
This money, according to the Copenhagen Treaty, was to be a & quot; new and additional to & quot; in order to ensure that an extra effort was made without prejudice to Official Development Assistance.
Unfortunately there is no consensus on what & quot; means new and additionally & quot;.
While the EU Commission had proposed a harmonization, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark they consider best.
The EU Commission, for example, has chosen itself as the benchmark for 2009: the international financing will be maintained, adding 150 million over three years to & quot;'s funding for & quot; Fast-Start & quot;.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at the level of Official Development Assistance.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of & quot; all new projects & quot; of 2010 was & quot; new and additionally & quot;.
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the amount spent in the preceding year, or at the global level of Official Development Assistance.
Specifically, the total sum of French support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to honour its commitment regarding the amount of new and additional & quot; funding.
Another key element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about this yet, and everyone chooses their arithmetic mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed €as the equivalent to 1 donated €.
Obviously, this is hard to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects tied to emission containment based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro you collect as the equivalent of one euro donated... Moreover, only the cost of the loan should be counted as a commitment for the country providing the funding (ie; the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in the sense except the following consideration: it respects & quot; its obligation of 420 million euros by taking 91.5% loan (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document for self-assurance.
France is the only EU country to make a large-scale loan application.
Germany claims 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) fulfil 100% of their obligations with donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to meet its obligations, France gives just 10 cents, and understands that to be a comparable amount.
Nice hocus-pocus!
All in all, France operates with a double swindle in its near-start financing: to one part with an evolution of the action over time, and to the other part with the reality of the financial expenditure.
France manages to be credited with having spent 420 million new & quot; million and extra quot; million in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros in the process.
Manipulating the Treasury (since it seems as though it was Bercy who did the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once inside the EU (why are the other member states continuing to donate when it is enough to borrow anyway?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely deceived after all...
The chapter of early funding only a small question on a relatively short time relative to the entirety of climate discussions.
But it could be the drop too many in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
However, it is imperative to learn its lesson from this first year of premature funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting type for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, France could bring to the front the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (another, crucial issue, and currently discussed): one cannot escape the question of & quot; transferability, & quot; or the accounting of its loans.
France could change its position to be just as progressive on the issues of dispute as it is on other things.
So the hope is based on the new Environment Minister Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about the fast-start of France, and its vision of & quot; transferability & quot; as well as the use of loans, would by nature lift the international confidence base necessary for further discussion.
Alarm - Pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years of age takes 81 different chemical substances during the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement for the protection of rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which declares that its results, given the small number of samples analyzed, do not represent a statistically significant value, but are an illustration of the problematic issues & quot; is dealing with, had purchased the foods usually consumed in four, plus one snack, from the supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five pieces of fresh fruit and fruit, three dairy products, and 1.5 liters of water a day - were studied as well as nibbles from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals, and other pollutants.
The plate balance is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possible or likely to be carcinogenic, and five classified as safe carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disruptors, according to studies of several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Center.
& quot; Even if, in the approximate totality of cases, the legal limits are not exceeded for each chemical, individually taken substance, it is nevertheless very well taken from this survey that the reality in which the consumer is possibly exposed to carcinogenic substances, or substances with endocrine disrupting factors, is worrying, notes the Association.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the possibly carcinogenic residues and three that have been proved to be safe to use as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, for which the study found traces of an insecticide strictly prohibited in the EU.
There were also the mincer steak, the tuna from the tin, even the baguette and chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances.
For tap water, the analyses have brought the presence of nitrates and chloroform to light.
At dinner, the salmon steak was at the most & quot; abundant with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this & quot; cocktail of harmful substances & quot; for the consumer & quot; is likely to be undervalued & quot;, according to the study.
For its part, the & quot; Alliance Europe Ecologie-Les Verts & quot; (EE-LV), in view of the urgency of the situation, has proposed to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the & quot; increasing frequency of civilization diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) regarding the presence of residues had identified 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables being consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
